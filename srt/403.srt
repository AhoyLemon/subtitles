64
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,239
Salem a hasty documentary let's take a

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,799
look Massachusetts

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,519
1692 with an Indian War raging near

67
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,680
nearby and Rifts forming in a

68
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,360
traditionally uniformed Church hysteria

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,079
grips the Puritan town of Salem from

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,480
Winter until the summer of this year

71
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,720
hundreds face accusations of

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,519
Witchcraft and many innocent people will

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,400
be executed you turn one guy into a toad

74
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,840
and and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm the bad guy the accusations come

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,360
from family neighbors friends and Men

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,800
about town I did not know she had cast

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,759
her lot with Satan not upon first gazing

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,520
her as it happens I asked to court her

80
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,520
and finding my wooing

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,280
denied that's when I began to suspect

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,759
her of richual he asked me to show him

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,240
my ankles my ankles what do I look like

84
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
a god Lutheran evidence needed to

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,880
convict a woman of Witchcraft was

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,759
minimal the important thing is that the

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,280
accused be linked back to Satan but this

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,720
was not always

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,960
easy look I make sexual congress with a

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,680
lot of Puritans what am I supposed to

91
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,880
remember every Goodie and Proctor that I

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,520
lay under the full moon

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,120
Jesus lacking corroboration from The

94
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,160
Lord of Darkness a confidently spoken

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,720
rumor would often do the trick I accuse

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,440
you of the dark

97
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,120
arts or we'd say I accuse you of being a

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,680
witch or I accuse you of witchery or

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,880
sometimes just witch witch you know

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
whatever whatever you feel at the moment

101
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,800
it will be months before the Panic of

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,600
the Salem Witch Trials comes to an end

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,919
and after that there will be a time of

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,319
Sorrow of reflection of

105
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,360
healing but until then each person must

106
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,080
look deep inside themselves and ask

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,960
whether they have what it takes to just

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,960
make up in

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,919

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,280
hear about you these movies I guess

137
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,560
people are watching but yeah the the

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,199
dreaming with the in audience we really

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,560
need to get that deliver that to you um

140
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,560
but yeah you started um as a playwright

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,360
uh back in the 60s um how did you make

142
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,400
that jump from from playwriting to this

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,160
yeah well I was just doing this for fun

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,680
and uh CU you we do plays and nobody

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,240
really does plays I me if you get one

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,440
and done a year you're lucky so I did

147
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
this on the side for grms thinking you

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,800
know at least I can write and do it so

149
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,720
that was so I just kept doing it and

150
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,280
then I thought this is nuts I can't

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,720
really be the comic I I never even

152
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,039
inspired anything really yeah and but

153
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,879
what inspired you to be a playr I

154
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,120
started watching uh I went to the

155
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,800
theater when I was a kid uh my father

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,560
took me to a show and then it's like

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,280
there's a I think there's a certain

158
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,080
quality to uh there's a certain group of

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,639
people much like heroin addicts that get

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,000
introduced to heroin and they decide

161
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,240
they want to do heroin and there's a

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
group of people that get into just to

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,280
theater there's a lot of vomiting with

164
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,000
both too well there is a lot of vomiting

165
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,680
especially if you write this stuff and

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,400
uh um so I uh I kind of got hooked on it

167
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,879
and I was kind of fascinated by it and

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,319
then I became more interested in then uh

169
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,680
but I couldn't write I mean I couldn't

170
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,720
act I couldn't direct um I wanted to be

171
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,599
a drama critic which is just and were a

172
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,959
few critics that I really thought really

173
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,680
wrote were and were as uh important as

174
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,680
the as the people writing stuff but

175
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,800
those guys have passed on very few of

176
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,320
those types left but um but that was so

177
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,120
I started I said I got to do some so I

178
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,320
started

179
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,880
running and as you said you're doing

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,040
comedy on the side just as something you

181
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,600
know it's kind of a diversion really um

182
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,519
and how did that end up outlasting uh

183
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,279
being a playright um uh being a

184
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,160
playright is the equivalent of uh uh

185
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:07,000
financially of Migrant R and less maybe

186
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,320
because um so I I ended up uh I was

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,800
doing the stuff on the side I would go

188
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,079
to I would do to go to theaters really

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,680
and and uh and do the stuff and then

190
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,360
when I made the when I got to New York I

191
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,760
tried to work in uh like uh The Improv

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,120
or catch rising star and I I just hated

193
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,399
the whole setup of it so I kind of stuck

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,880
to my own M then I started running my

195
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,120
own space in New York and uh with some

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,720
other guys and uh would introduce every

197
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,800
show and the more that I introduce shows

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,399
the more comfortable I became uh and

199
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
then I was kind of started people

200
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,200
started to kind of uh you know after 3

201
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,480
or four years I was kind of known within

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,160
at least the New York Community um we

203
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,880
would do a free show on Saturdays

204
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,079
because most of our friends were

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,640
brok so you the responses were favorable

206
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,440
early on uh yeah I mean you know I mean

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
at least I was I was figuring it out

208
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,720
pretty quickly once I figured out what

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,880
was what I I started to figure out how

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,399
to uh

211
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,000
uh get it across to to any audience and

212
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,560
has the voice matured like that as well

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,760
I mean is I mean basically I mean

214
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
everybody knows you is you know there's

215
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
a lot of pointing and a lot of lot of

216
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
yelling I mean was that at the beginning

217
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,720
as well the beginning was no the

218
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,360
beginning was mostly uh I was angry but

219
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
not really showing it another comic from

220
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Michigan Dan ballor came up to me one

221
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,079
night at the club and said uh you're you

222
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,800
know you're you're uh you're um you're

223
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,120
angry but you're not yelling and I'm not

224
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
angry and I'm yelling you should be

225
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,839
yelling yelling M go up there and yell

226
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,360
and I did and that kind of and then it

227
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,079
became and then I that's what really

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,240
created the final kind of a nail on it

229
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
and that's when so and then just you

230
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,720
know just touring around doing small

231
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,200
clubs here and there uh what did you do

232
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,040
that got the attention of The Daily Show

233
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,800
and you look at that as the big jump I

234
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,399
mean was well it was a big it turned out

235
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,120
to be the big jump at the time I just

236
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,600
thought well that's it's great I mean I

237
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,480
was GL to be you know just GL to be on a

238
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
a show and I assume at this point you

239
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,120
have to be like one of the longest

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,920
standing members if not I am yeah

241
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,240
there's nobody with the with coar

242
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,519
leaving I'm in I'm the last I'm the Last

243
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,519
Comic

244
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,959
Standing and um so now you made the jump

245
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
and you're doing a fair amount of movies

246
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,279
uh you're just with uh Robin Williams um

247
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
and with with The

248
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,839
uncomp Wil

249
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,079
vama yeah how's he to work with he's

250
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,720
actually he's like two people he's the

251
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,519
guy you read about in the paper and uh

252
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,600
you know because he goes in somewhere

253
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,519
and uh and you know and beautiful women

254
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,720
you know writes up to him and then we do

255
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,760
the movie and he's got no brings no BS

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,160
to the table none he was the one yeah

257
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,040
and what's it like with having a player

258
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,279
right background doing uh movies you

259
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,839
know I mean is it are you picking it

260
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,160
apart or going the hell is that really I

261
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,760
don't really stick my nose into

262
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,839
anybody's writing cuz uh unless I have I

263
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,040
kind of go oh like I you know this is

264
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,880
fastic you know uh you get um people

265
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,800
writing that you know that somehow and

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,760
and this I find this just it's just so

267
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,040
irritating from intelligent people that

268
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,000
you get in you know you you you start

269
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,079
reading about well I can't believe he

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,959
made the choice to do that movie well

271
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,519
like I have choices yeah um yeah and um

272
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,440
are you worried about uh being typ

273
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,000
casted from the character you know that

274
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,760
you know you do live that you do on uh

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,440
you know it doesn't bother me um what's

276
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,360
interesting thing there again is is that

277
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,519
people get upset that in the movies I'm

278
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,160
not doing what I do MH and it's like

279
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,680
well you you you're damned if you do and

280
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,440
you're damned if you don't so um so

281
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,079
screw them all really yeah really so I

282
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,680
mean if I you know if as long as I feel

283
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,720
like um there's something uh to be

284
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,720
gained in doing that character I'll do

285
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
it um yeah and the HBO specials I mean

286
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
that's you know a totally different

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,839
things I mean you're basically walking

288
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,000
in coling all the shots I mean how's

289
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,320
that been working for you I mean you

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,120
really I mean this has to be just

291
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,720
another dream come true basically carry

292
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,800
as much time as you want and just like

293
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,000
basically go up there and [ __ ] in front

294
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
of a whole bunch of people and they all

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,760
then they all love it and it's on HBO I

296
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,040
yeah no that's been uh that was a huge

297
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,920
uh that's the biggest as far as I'm

298
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,760
concerned as comic that's what I aspired

299
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,279
to um in that uh yeah and um to tight

300
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,639
all in I know Minneapolis has kind of

301
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,000
played a weird role uh for you here I

302
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,639
mean cuz it seem you taped a lot of the

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,240
