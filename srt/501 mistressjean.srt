shot all right uh before I I actually

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
tell you the shot I got a little story

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,799
uh the neighborhood I grew up in in

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,439
South Minneapolis in the in the mid '70s

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,360
uh there was this place that I always

44
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,599
thought was a Thai restaurant and it was

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,039
called the bamboo Hut and uh one day I

46
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,400
was out walking around and I was kind of

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,360
hungry and I went in and everything on

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,599
the menu was really really expensive and

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,800
I couldn't figure it out and uh so I

50
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,239
turned around and walked out but the the

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,480
one thing that that I remember was uh

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
there was something called the happy

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,480
ending and it was

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,920
$100 and I'm trying to think you know

55
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,920
what the hell is worth a hundred bucks

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,000
at a at a place called the bamboo Hut

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,879
and I still haven't figured it out out

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but in honor of that tonight's shot is

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
called the happy

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,879
ending and to make a happy

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,280
