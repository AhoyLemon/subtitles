00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,800
know what the street value of 500 mlit

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,839
of of blood is probably like 30 bucks

208
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,200
not bad yeah um but hey he's not just

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,760
talking about it he's actually doing it

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,880
let's uh take a look at some of a we got

211
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,839
a short film here showing you in

212
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,760
action so here we have the Jimmy

213
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,279
Hendricks one oh it's choppy

214
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,880
oh well when we put it in later I'm sure

215
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,120
it'll look great here okay here's HRI

216
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,480
and all the all the matches and then

217
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,360
this piece this was 30 different

218
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,880
pictures I painted one on top of another

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,760
they was were all people or things that

220
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,680
represented people that influenced me

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,240
and at the end here I actually peel the

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,720
entire thing off it about a qu in thick

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,040
and I was able to cut a self-portrait

224
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
out of it all the influences and here's

225
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
my Bruce Lee one many people have seen

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,160
this one I dip my hand in paint and Kate

227
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,880
chop the wall to make a picture of Bruce

228
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,839
Lee and sometimes I use my head or my

229
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,760
feet or whatever well yeah you got paint

230
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,120
you got body parts why

231
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,519
not yeah 14t 7 and 1/2 ft tall somewhere

232
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,839
long in there boom that was pretty

233
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,160
awesome

234
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,160
now we get to see the reason for the

235
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,600
tricycle I wrote up on this is my newest

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,360
piece uh so I was able to pour paint

237
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,880
into that top part and it dripped onto

238
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,160
the wheels and I rode around and

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,360
eventually I was able to make a picture

240
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,640
of Lance Armstrong after two weeks worth

241
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,760
of work that thing's damn yeah 12 pretty

242
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,240
intense that was huge and and that's the

243
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,000
clip okay wow well more round of

244
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,720
applause for Philip here this is

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,399
insane now um and they said this is on

246
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,480
YouTube now you get a lot of hits people

247
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,720
checking out what you're doing yeah

248
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,000
online it's kind of wild uh I I think

249
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,480
people I you know I always strive to

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
keep my work as high quality as possible

251
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,560
so I'm not putting crap out there yeah

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
so whenever I put something out people

253
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
tend to go for it and I've have

254
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
somewhere around 20 million views

255
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
overall now damn now how interactive

256
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,360
does this get I mean I know that I know

257
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,040
you've done some work but they actually

258
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,800
relied heavily on the people who are who

259
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,360
are watching you do this stuff on the

260
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,320
internet like how's that affected you um

261
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,760
well actually I tend to be I tend to

262
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
isolate myself more now than that's what

263
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,600
happens when it start talking to people

264
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
like yeah I'm done yeah originally you

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
know it was great because all this you

266
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,560
know all these emails and everything

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,839
then I realized that you know I got a

268
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,920
lot of hate emails well that doesn't

269
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,720
make you feel good that doesn't make you

270
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,880
think you're heading in the right

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,959
direction so after a while I was just

272
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,279
like screw it and just kind of kept

273
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
doing my own thing and ignored a lot of

274
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,800
it yeah ignore hate maale people it's

275
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,600
just drags you down we don't have time

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,000
for the hater

277
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,240
R all right um now how do the internet

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
actually change your art now did you

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,160
make it did you start aiming for what

280
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,360
people were looking for or did you just

281
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,680
totally you know get rid of that like uh

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
well I mean because I mean the large uh

283
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,279
what's what's the one it's the large

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,519
round one um a moment I call it a moment

285
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,600
yeah and that one and tell people about

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,040
this one cuz this one's really cool yeah

287
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,959
this one it was a 10ft rotating disc

288
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,200
kind of like this table except 10 ft and

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,760
the whole thing would spin I spent uh 6

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,959
days locked in my brother's garage I had

291
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,200
um a bed there everything I ordered food

292
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,000
so I never left the garage for six days

293
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,800
and I took phone calls I broadcast my

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
phone number on the internet had people

295
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,920
