me that' be called roof sets cuz they

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
knew I'd never allow something like that

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,479
on drinking with E and that would just

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,479

that well if you didn't drink as much as

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,760
of write it out that's that's very true

149
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
