little bit different yeah there's

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,480
nothing wrong with being an accessory to

a major crime yeah and you've been

305
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,079
involved with the show since pretty much

306
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,199

of practice it was a life of PT up

314
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,000
frustration yeah so you've had some big

315
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800

on the cover though that's pretty insane

324
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,880
um you know it's just a lot of years of

325
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
hard work doing comedy and doing it at a

326
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,079
level that uh was kind of accidental but

327
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,440
like stepping in at the top he runs a

328
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,160

332
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,519
Grammy on your uh on your mantle piece I

333
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,800

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,480
label and I produced his uh Carnegie

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,279
Hall album and we wound up uh getting

340
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,079
the Grammy in 2007 yeah I mean that's

341
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,240
that's a big deal man and I mean did you

342
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,759
ever think when you were starting this

343
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,199
cuz you started I know your roots uh

344
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,399
he's started is just doing a little punk

345
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,519
label you know back in Nebraska yeah

346
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,399
yeah in my dorm room in uh in Lincoln

347
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,399
Nebraska at the University uh thereof I

348
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,639
I started and had my closet was my

349
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,600
warehouse and uh you know we did a lot

350
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,480
of bands we did 70 records with bands

351
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,759
from uh the Midwest 70 I didn't realize

352
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,360
he did that many however you know the

353
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,199
reality was you know bands that I

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,480
idolized were like fugazi and the Jesus

355
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,440
lizard and buildozer and these are bands

356
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,320
that uh nobody really knew of let alone

357
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,440
could possibly ever be in the contention

358
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,160
for for Award of so to me it was

359
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
something that was like it was out there

360
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,480
but it wasn't anything that could ever

361
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,040
be remotely associated with anything

362
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,959
that I yeah no I I understand that not

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
yeah bands like the bands we like aren't

364
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,079
the ones that get big awards no um so

365
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
what made you make the jump into comedy

366
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,839
after you just done dealing with punk

367
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
rock I was well you know I helped

368
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,120
discover a big band from Iowa called

369
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,320
slipnot and they he is to blame I am I

370
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,279
am partially partially not entirely yeah

371
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,959
uh once they signed to a bigger label

372
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,360
they kind of turned their back on uh the

373
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,440
people that helped them get to that

374
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,440
level and uh once they moved on I was it

375
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,079
coincided with when I moved here okay so

376
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,079
it was a good time to fold up that

377
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,320
business because it was a lot of

378
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,959
heartache and not a lot of reward either

379
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
spiritually or financially I mean and

380
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,680
that's the thing I mean yeah nobody ever

381
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
does a record label as a career path

382
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,639
they do a record label because they

383
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,519
really like music exact and I think a

384
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,160
lot of people end up stop liking music

385
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,639
as much because they end up you know

386
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,000
blowing a lot of time a lot of energy

387
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
and a lot of money yeah yeah I ran up

388
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,040
credit cards you know I mean I ran up

389
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,079
credit cards to ridiculous ridiculous uh

390
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
sums and you know when I approached

391
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,800
Lewis it was on the hope that it was

392
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,240
going to be a one-off thing maybe we'd

393
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,519
sell a th000 copies and it would be

394
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,399
awesome I'd get to work with this guy

395
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,040
who I was a fan of anyway and you just

396
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,920
basically walked up to him after a show

397
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,360
this wasn't like my manager will contact

398
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
your manager kind of stuff no no what

399
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,959
what was funny was I I was working a day

400
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,600
job at the time doing text support so I

401
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,680
was driving home from work and I heard

402
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
that he was at the comedy club I ran up

403
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,240

404
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,440

408
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,759
care I want a

409
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,959
premium anyway don't shoot

410
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,480
me yes it wasn't that your manager

411
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
contacting their man I went I went to

412
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,959
the club and it was really funny cuz I'd

413
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,839
been here so few a little amount of time

414
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,199
I didn't have any uh I didn't have any

415
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,040
stationary I didn't have any business

416
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,680
cards so I took a lined uh notebook and

417
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,920
wrot and basically basically wrote uh

418
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,639
I'm not a stalker I'm a fan I put out

419
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,279
records I want to work with you and

420
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,120
amazingly enough nobody had contacted

421
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,920
him yet no one had contacted at this

422
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
because that was kind of like I that was

423
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,199
like the NAT of Comedy recording really

424
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,959
cuz there wasn't too much stuff going on

425
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,959
other than like you know you know crap

426
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,639
like is before L the cable guy but like

427
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,639
Jeff Foxworthy type Foxworthy going

428
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,600
Chris Rock was just barely starting up

429
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,440
recording at this time it was mainly on

430
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,240
cable like pay Network at that time and

431
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,519
not many albums so I happened to step in

432
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,519
and you know Lewis had just been

433
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,199
rejected Ed by Warner Brothers Comedy

434
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,720
Central was not interested in a record

435
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,480
label at that point in their history

436
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
yeah so it was the right place at the

437
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,400
right time and then it was just a matter

438
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
of staying in touch with his management

439
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,199
for a few months and then the next thing

440
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,439
you know we're recording right before

441
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,240
Thanksgiving in Madison Wisconsin nice

442
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,919
this is in 99 and as you mentioned yeah

443
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,880
I mean Comedy Central was not interested

444
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,959
in doing uh record label at the time but

445
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,760
now they are now they're like your

446
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,079
number one competition they are yeah

447
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,880
they they started out Strong by like uh

448
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,000
aping what I did but with more money

449
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,280
behind them so yeah so watch out no it's

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,360
the way it is I mean it's literally

451
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,000
David versus Goliath oh yeah cuz they're

452
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,760
backed by is that that's Warner Brothers

453
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,960
money right it's viom and Warner

454
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,160
Brothers and you're but you're but

455
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,559

456
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,400
out of his house I'm a dude running it

457
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,360
out of a house in a storage St yeah so I

458
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,600
mean but still you're managing I mean

459
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,000
despite them being backed by gazillions

460
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,200
of dollars you're still kind of kicking

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,640
their ass aren't you kind of yeah I mean

462
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,240
as far as edgy you know

463
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,679
thought-provoking material that's where

464
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,559
we're at you know that's what we care

465
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,640
about and uh you know you know there's

466
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,200
always going to be somebody that doesn't

as long as I have that going for me

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
it'll be fine and if you're anybody

470
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
that's not going to want to deal with a

471
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,799
large corporation it's going to be

472
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,000
comedians cuz they're all a bunch of

473
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,440
