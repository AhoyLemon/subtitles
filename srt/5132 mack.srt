273
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
you're basically plucked out even though

274
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,040
you're already a touring comedian do you

275
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,959
prefer comedian or comedian folk

276
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,639
humorist folk humorist all right yeah

277
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
you've been a touring folk humorist for

278
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
a long time or not a long time but for a

279
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
while you you weren't you weren't

280
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,399
obscure and then somehow you ended up on

281
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,600
Last Comic Standing uh how did you find

282
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,199
yourself doing that was it against your

283
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,959
wishes it sounds like it might have been

284
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,440
well they called me and asked me to do

285
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:34,440
it because it's reality television

286
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,759
um the and that's how that works so but

287
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,759
uh but now I started out in

288
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,759
paa

289
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,880

294
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,680
the at the end cuz um you know that way

295
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,959
that's that's how you'd find it in the

296
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,639
Yellow Pages yep set ourselves apart

297
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,199
from all the other po bands in Nashville

298
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,720
Tennesse at that time and so yeah we

299
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,319
started out like that and then we were

300
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,600
pretty bad so I just St for time yeah

301
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,279
and uh people running get between the

302
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,240
one timeing out with somebody do you

303
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
know one time we were playing everybody

304
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,160
was always drunk and so I'm I'm a good

305
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,880
guest for you and um but one time I

306
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,000
looked I always played in the front you

307
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,319
know clarinet or whatever and uh one

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
time I heard something weird going on in

309
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:40,199
the Rhythm Section and I looked back and

310
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,240
the tuba player was laying on the ground

311
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,440
he was just on the ground and I was like

312
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,360
asked the drummer what happened I knew

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,839
he wasn't dead cuz he was he was a PO

314
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
that's a good insurance to have yeah cuz

315
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,160
I generally just assume stand's dead but

316
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,920
he was laying on the ground like he was

317
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,360
still sitting in the chair like RI

318
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,680
mortis had set in you know and he's and

319
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,079
but I knew he wasn't dead cuz he was

320
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,799
still trying to play and uh and I asked

321
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,280
the drummer and and she said I said what

322
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,280
happened and she's like he just tipped

323
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,240
over and so they yeah that was how good

324
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,559
we were I drank a lot but I guess the

325
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,679
power of Poa has never uh reduced me to

326
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,799
a a pile of a pile of guy on the floor

327
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,720

328
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,280
