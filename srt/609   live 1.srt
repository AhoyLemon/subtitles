185
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,400
what's going to come to this um so what

186
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
are your thoughts because you you look

187
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,599
you know when when jerks talk about the

188
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,319
comedy scene there's obviously you got

189
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
your New York and your La that's how it

190
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,560
was in the 70s how do you think uh being

191
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
a Midwest comic has worked to your

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,919
advantage at disadvantage and how has

193
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,800
that kind of informed what you

194
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,560
do uh good question I guess out wrot

195
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,399
that one down right

196
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,720
here New York and La uh I think there's

197
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
a little bit more pressure a little bit

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,120
more competition I think uh artists

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
comedians have a little bit more room to

200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,959
be creative and grow and be their

201
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,839
individual self there's great audiences

202
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,079
out here which means you can do smart

203
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,360
comedy I think you can develop a smarter

204
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,839
act here here and um I think it's a good

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
place to become a comedian and I think

206
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
it's one of the best comedy towns in the

207
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
country right now as it was when I

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
started are we talking about Minneapolis

209
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,120
Minnesota Minneapolis Minnesota comedy

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,320
Town USA am I

211
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,600
right now and it says so right there in

212
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,200
your bio that you're a bit of an

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,959
unconventional comic which means that

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,360
you will play places other comedians

215
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,079

218
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,000
accomplishment the promoter thought I'd

219
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,240
be perfect for uh his clientele and the

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,040
people who were coming out to that which

221
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,519

222
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,760
45-year-old white dude with no holes or

223
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,680

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,360
the tattoo convention is uh just

232
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,959

Campground Alie Osborne was there wow no

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,079
kidding look at that so sturis huh cuz

238
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,320

239
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,200
it scares of B Jesus out of me should I

240
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,160
be I've heard something about a a a

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
pickle that gets licked what happens

242
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,320
here here you know last year uh I was my

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,040
idea to go out there I uh pitched my

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
idea to the owner he said come on out

245
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,800
try to find an audience and it was tough

246
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,320
to find an audience so one of the places

247
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,079
I found an audience was following a

248
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,959
pickle licking contest and and what and

249
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,720
what is this pickle licking contest well

250
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,680
I think you can guess the rules okay uh

251
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,000
you got a look a pickle different ladies

252
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:58,279
did their best job at um getting the

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,040
audience to imagine that they were

254
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,399
putting the something else besides a

255
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,320
pickle in their mouth and making the

256
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,399
recipient of whoever that pickle was

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,880
attached to

258
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,399
happy I find that that cheapens pickles

259
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,839
you know what I don't think it does much

260
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,959
for pickles either and as far as comedy

261
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,519
it really cheap in the comedy too yeah

262
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,040
and yeah because how do you go over I

263
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,079
mean how do you follow a pickle licking

264
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,440
contest you know let's just say that it

265
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,160
didn't attract the classiest of

266
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,920
competitors on two different occasions I

267
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,600
watched in great Fascination as one of

268
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,279
the contestants made a great show of

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,560
first removing her

270
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,639
teeth In fairness you don't want your

271
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,399
pickle

272
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,079
scraped nobody forgets a pickle scraping

273
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,480
uh I'm not saying it's bad for pickle

274
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,800
licking but it's not easy for comedy

275
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,800
following but but you found to this

276
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,680
because how many have you have you done

277
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,920
this in previous years uh this is my

278
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,560
second year and this year the uh owner

279
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,800
of the Buffalo Chip you know he asked me

280
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
how it went I said it's tough to do

281
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
comedy outside for a skeptical audience

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,680
I took a pickle you know I took a

283
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,680
grubbin from the pickle and judges a

284
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,120
couple of times and this year he moved

when I was 19 years old and I've never

297
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,120
owned a motorcycle since but bikers have

298
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,760
always kind of liked what I do I like to

299
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,519

they might like uh this one's good for

305
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,120
TV too I know I've gotten older my

306
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,720
sensibilities have changed like when I

307
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,680
was younger it was like I had to get

308
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,480
drunk in order to have a good time

309
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,399
now I don't have to have a good

310
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,199
time now because you are really like a

311
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,800
like a current King of the oneliner like

314
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
based and do you think that's found a

315
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,199
good Niche for you you know for the bike

316
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,240

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,480
no

318
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,839
attention they're like skeptical say

319
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,079
something funny and I go like uh just

320
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,320
watch my first porno movie can't believe

321
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,279

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,240
there so I do real quick back and it's

323
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,079
almost like they're almost like

324
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,720
challenging me it's like extreme comedy

325
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,639
and by the way I've got more edgy ones

326
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,440
for the motorcycle rally but we're on TV

327
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,440
here come on yeah no no no and this is

328
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,560
good so now and how many dates do you do

329
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,959
in a year because you're a bit of a road

330
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,320
dog aren't you well you know what for

331
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,760
seven years Road dog is what we call a

332
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,839
comedian who works a

333
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,079
lot if in case you couldn't figure that

334
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,560
out which means that you're kind of

335
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,279
stupid I don't think I'm hacking this

336
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,440
joke because we we use it so much in

337
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,240
comics but you know what you call a um

338
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:05,000

you know when you work they put you up

343
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,279

gig anywhere just so they get you a

345
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,120
