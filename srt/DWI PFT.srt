21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,519
comedy thing well you know it's a funny

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,760
story Ian um not really but it is a

24
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,359
story all right uh I always wanted to do

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,519
stand up but I was never sure how to go

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,640
about it and uh I had a friend of mine

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,400
who was a little bit older in high

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,759
school who went to uh Arizona State and

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,000
started getting into stand out there and

30
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,840
then came back to Philly and said you

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
want to get an act together and that was

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,840
it we like cobbled something together

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,080
and uh we were a team for about year and

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,439
a half then we started hating each other

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,960
which is what happens with comedy teams

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
uh and then I just kept doing it by

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,400
myself and despite them exactly exactly

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,439
nobody's going to tell me I'm not good

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,880
enough and do do you uh you credit that

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,000
for your your meteor eyes uh the sheer

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,479
you know the best revenge is living well

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,399
yeah if if meteors are uh super slow

43
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,360
then yes okay like one of those slow

44
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,960
moving meteors okay yeah I can't imagine

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840
there's a booming comedy scene in

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,040
Philadelphia that's where you're right

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
uh yeah what was great about Phil well I

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,880
started around the time of the comedy

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,000
boom in the uh the late 80s and there

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,280
was a lot of work in the city and the

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,479
suburbs and all that stuff so you didn't

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,479
have to travel that far from home to

53
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,520
make a living then the bottom dropped

54
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,240
out and I was back to being broke so uh

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,880
I moved to Los Angeles in 1994 how long

56
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,640
did it take you to get on uh the the

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,640
well-known Mr show CU that started what

58
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,959
95 95 yeah and I started working on that

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,440
in '96 so uh I was I was pretty lucky

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,599
pretty lucky and it's pretty hateful how

61
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,200
quickly I managed to secure gainful

62
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,519
employment in Show Business and and and

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,160
well-known gainful employment and how

64
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,040
much of that has come come back kind of

65
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,280
retroactively he used to be like used to

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,519
be a rich man show cuz you had to have

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,920
to pay cable absolutely abolutely it's

68
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,040
for all those fat cats people watching

69
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,040
through their monal at home it like it

70
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,000
went from occasionally being recognized

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,480
from that show to uh even more

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,640
occasionally being recognized from that

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,440
show uh but it was it was a great thing

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,840
yeah it went from being like a cult hit

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,840
to uh uh a little bit less of a cult

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,360
yeah you know a very large cult like

77
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,959
more organized religion like Scientology

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,440
okay very nice and what was it like

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
working in an environment like that

80
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,400
because it was all I mean how many has

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,200
tape new episodes pretty much every week

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,720
yeah um and how how involved were you

83
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,879
with the writing how I mean talking

84
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,360
about you know just two two comedians

85
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,920
starting to hate each other I mean how

86
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
quickly did there 10 going to start

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,040
turning on each other and breaking out

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,920
knives it was a room full of hate yeah

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,599
um it was it was a we actually got along

90
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,879
pretty well I think despite the grueling

91
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,120
circumstances because it was we were all

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,159
writing and performing in every episode

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,879
and it was sketch so we were doing stuff

94
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,840
on location and doing stuff live so it

95
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,879
was a it was a lot of work and a very

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
small amount of time um but we I I I

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,360
still look back at that it's amazing

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,720
that it retains the quality that it does

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,680
you the circumstances you know what I

100
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,799

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,799
Tenacious D television program so on

110
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,000

town ah the rails such a romantic place

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,799
to be Bey why do they have to uh yes

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
Tenacious D was a uh that was a really

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,280
fun thing to be a part of and I wish we

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,720
could have done more of those but uh I

118
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,600
just uh got to be in the movie yeah

119
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,960
which is in post production right now

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,440
and I repre my role of the open my Hast

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,120
um and I actually have uh a few more

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,360
scenes um and I realized recently that

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,720
uh I can't be cut out because my stuff

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,880
is married to too many important things

125
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,680
so uh my part is safe and secure very

126
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,320
good and there only like Eight Episodes

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,960
or eight 15minute vignettes or something

128
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,520
like that there's like six well there's

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,520
less than 10 less let's say less than 10

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
and somehow I mean this just really just

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
took off yet again due to um you know

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
people just trading tapes around and did

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,120
you see that pick up like walking around

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,199
town like oh my God you're the guy that

135
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,160
asked that that's asked to read things

136
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,960
oh yeah yeah that that picked up uh uh

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,120
even faster than Mr show you know it was

138
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,360
it was insane and then once Jack Black

139
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,600
kind of really took off it it became

140
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,720
even more insane like I used to open for

141
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,160
those guys um live you know they do live

142
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,960
dates and uh I remember when it was just

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,120
like a sort of fun kind of thing to do

144
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,639
to when it became this monster

145
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,720
experience and the first time I did it

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
after it become huge uh I barely got out

147
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,680
of there alive like if I had not been

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,479
connected with the TV show if I just

149
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,319
been a comic would they would have

150
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,120
killed me yeah yeah and so it was

151
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,080
basically like an inside joke to start

152
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,319
like everybody just kind of thought it

153
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,280
was funny and then next thing you know

154
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,120
the Frat Boys love the tenaci KE oh they

155
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,360
do indeed and and what's the crossover

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,720
there what do you think the appeal is

157
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,800
for your uh your general f app you know

158
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,080
people like energy and swearing yeah and

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,880
uh the D have that in abundance yeah um

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,199
and you really can't go wrong you know

161
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,000
especially if you're hammered no get it

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,280
yeah D The Pick of Destiny um you got

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,759
any spoilers for the uh the

164
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,160
hardworking would dream of spoiling this

165
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,759
film and I did call it a film um it's

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
going to be really funny like I've read

167
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,880
the script and uh you know I thought it

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,880
was funny and this will be fun to do and

169
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,560
then actually seeing the stuff executed

170
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,960
and I got to watch some dailies and

171
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,680
everything it's really going to be

172
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,360
hilarious it's really going to be

173
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,680
hilarious now after that um or maybe

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,639
during that let's just say after that uh

175
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,280
you went over to England to tap a little

176
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,000
television show very little called the

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,680
sketch show now is it featuring Kelsey

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,240
gramar is it just with Kelsey it was

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,599
Kelsey gramar presents the sketch show

181
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,520
can imagine um we like to call it Kelsey

182
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,520
gramar resents the sketch show since he

183
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,960
never showed up in England to uh do any

184
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,360
of the stuff we taped this is all like

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
okay oh yeah we taped with Mr gramar uh

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,160
the day after we got back from two

187
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,360
months of being in London um you know

188
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,840
got back to America at 9:30 at night and

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,120
then yeah so be here on the lot at 7: in

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,360
the morning and uh Mr gramar will see

191
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,800
you yeah Mr grammar will see you we'll

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,479
redo some of the sketches we already did

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,680
in England but with Kelsey and them as a

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,280
choice yeah you know but we were all so

195
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,720
thrilled to be back by that point we

196
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,039
didn't care you know we would have shot

197
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,720
all day long yeah um yeah that show

198
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,000
didn't didn't work out so well now did

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
you see this while you're were taping it

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,479
was this like one of those things just

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,879
wasn't like oh this is going to be great

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,479
I could see in the editing I can see

203
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,120
this all come together in a beautiful

204
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,000
beautiful package it became apparent

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,919
very very quickly we had a uh uh

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,840
producers who wanted us to just sort of

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,840
replicate the original uh you know

208
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,919
performances of the British cast yeah

209
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,400
because this was uh very popular unlike

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
in America it was very popular British

211
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,800
show yes for a very brief period of time

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,000
it was popular for a very brief period

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
of time okay um they got two seasons out

214
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,599
of it 12 episodes and then um which is

215
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,240
like 190 sketches I think exactly yeah

216
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,000
yeah yeah and like the idea of it wasn't

217
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,240
bad you know fast sketches and um sort

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,159
of you know one joking out but but it

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
was the jokes themselves I think that

220
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,280
there was a problem there I mean it's

221
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,840
it's puns and things like that I think

222
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,639
that when you're trying to sell that to

223
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,479
America you have to let the American

224
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,319
performers give American performances

225
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,800
and it became very clear very early that

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,240
there is a big difference between the

227
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,960
way we do things and the way they do

228
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,080
things and it's not necessarily going to

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,960
work you know here and it didn't yeah

230
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,560
now was it in all like British crew I me

231
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,000
were they basically telling you what was

232
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,680
funny yeah not really I mean most of the

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,039
people were pretty cool but we we did

234
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,680
have a producer who you know didn't feel

235
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,880
that comedy was subjective you know that

236
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,839
it's it's it's either funny or it's not

237
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,240
and if it's been funny once this way

238
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,399
then that's the way that's the only way

239
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,640
that it's funny and it was uh an

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
enormously frustrating experience you

241
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,200
know and I felt like I was the only one

242
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,600
who knew that this was going to be a

243
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,920
huge failure and uh I was right so I get

244
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,240
some comfort that I supp this isn't even

245
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,839
one of those things where you thought

246
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,560
well you know maybe a second season

247
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,120
we'll get we'll take care of all of that

248
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,200
no you know what I did I thought if we

249
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,720
could if we could stand if we could stay

250
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
on the air long enough that maybe we

251
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,320
could kind of do it right you know shoot

252
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,880
it in America for American audiences I

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,600
mean it's it's a tough thing to be

254
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,399
Americans performing for a British

255
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
studio audience and you know the

256
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,680
producers would say well it's it's 50%

257
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
American out there tonight well in

258
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,320
America it's 100% American and you don't

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
have to worry about you know whether or

260
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,600
not they're going to get little

261
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,680
subtleties in language and things like

262
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,720
that because basically we just ended up

263
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,480
americanizing the British sketches and

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,279
saying elevator instead of lift and

265
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,200
stuff like that and you know it just

266
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,320
didn't work now do you think you're kind

267
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,040
of uh cast on the show because of the

268
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,360
experience on Mr Show and because you're

269
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,079
also reunited no uh because the first

270
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,800
round of casting um I did not make the

271
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,360
second cut and then it was the network

272
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,959
it was Fox who said are you guys crazy

273
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,160
this guy is is really good we need to

274
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,519
have him on this show so then I got to

275
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,040
kind of go back in for the network uh

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
audition wow you were actually picked by

277
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,000
yeah yeah what's that like that's almost

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,399
like good news and bad news same time

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
enormously flattering question mark yeah

280
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,079
you know and do you uh consider yourself

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
kind of spoiled working in an

282
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,399
environment like Mr Show and then going

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
to something very regimented that that

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,519
spoiled me for the rest of my career

285
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,760
because it was uh you know a show where

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,279
everyone cared about what they were

287
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,040
doing and I just haven't had that

288
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,040
experience many times since then you

289
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,880
know uh these were guys who had an

290
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,959
enormous Clarity of vision they knew

291
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,200
exactly what they were doing what they

292
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,079
were all about and uh they put in a lot

293
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,640
of time to make sure that it was done

294
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,320
right you know it was the hardest thing

295
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,480
on that show if you remember there were

296
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,839
the little links between the scenes um

297
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,040
so everything kind of led into

298
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,639
everything else and that it was very

299
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,160
important to them and to all of us that

300
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,720
they be little scenes under themselves

301
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,839
and that it wasn't just always as easy

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
as coming out of a newspaper photo or

303
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,720
coming out of a commercial TV yeah

304
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,760
exactly so it was uh that was tough and

305
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,959
we would spend many a late night you

306
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,160
know working on those things but rather

307
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,760
than just kind of throwing up our hands

308
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,240
and saying that's good enough

309
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,680
you know it was there was always an

310
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,160
effort to make it good you know you're

311
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,320
uh changing things little by little in

312
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,800
La you have the paf Tomkin show now tell

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,560
me about this this isn't something

314
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,959
that's taped for television this is just

315
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,680
basically you a gaggle of friends in a

316
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,519
stage if if I understand it was

317
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,880
something that it's a variety show it's

318
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,040
something that I I wanted to do just

319
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,680
purely creatively you know without uh

320
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,360
trying to get you know networks down to

321
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,480
see it it was just there's enough of

322
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,800
that in my life you know trying to

323
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,839
maintain my career and I thought I just

324
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,440
want to do something that's going to be

325
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,880
fun and uh it ended up being more it

326
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,079
ended up being the most fun thing I've

327
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,920
ever done it's uh you know music and

328
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,279
comedy and I get to work with uh amazing

329
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,760
people like uh you know Dave Foley and

330
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,560
Andy RoR and uh you know Jack Black has

331
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,959
done the show a couple times uh and then

332
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,720
musicians like Amy man and F apple and

333
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,760
Nickel Creek and stuff like that it's

334
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,760
it's enormously satisfying to do and how

335
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,600
much longer do you see yourself doing

336
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
that is that something that could just

337
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,320
go on forever I'll keep doing it whether

338
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,519
it gets it's on television or not I'll

339
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,079
keep doing it because it's uh it's just

340
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,519
a lot of fun and I it's been like three

341
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
and a half years now so I feel like I've

342
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,760
really uh it's it's evolved over that

343
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
time where it's really nice and tight

344
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,519
and uh it's it's a fun it's a fun show

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,360
it's been sold out since the very first

346
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,800
performance and uh you know it seems

347
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,880
like people keep coming back because

348
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,720
even though they don't know what's going

349
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
to be on the show necessarily they trust

350
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,480
me enough that it's going to be

351
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,000
enjoyable yeah you know and it's worth

352
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,279
$10 yeah hey well Paul thanks for
