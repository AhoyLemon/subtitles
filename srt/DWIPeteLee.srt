you moved up here right out of there

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,639

bad really is Jamesville Wisconsin um

143
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,759
all right I'll answer your first

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,319
question ver um why did I come to I I

145
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,560
went to the University of Minnesota of

146
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,120
course okay and um and basically I did

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,560
that because I didn't get accepted to

148
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,680
the University of Wisconsin yeah so

149
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,280
that's why because the Badgers won the

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Rose bow the year before I went to

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
college was why I went to this cool

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
comedy City really so like if I would

153
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,599
have gone there I'd probably be just

154
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
some fat Wisconsin I you know like

155
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,759
reliving my Glory Days and working at

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,360
Menards so You' be you I mean by saying

157
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,160
by saying a fat you're being a bit

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,960
redundant you you just be a wisconsinite

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440

160
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,639

when you moved here you had no

228
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,480
aspirations for comedy and Minneapolis

229
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,920
made you into the comedian you are I

230
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,360

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,839
lot of people talk about how important

235
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,000
Minneapolis is to the comedy scene all

236
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,480
of those people live in

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,040
Minneapolis um now how does it how does

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,040
it rank nationally because you you moved

239
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,279
away right you're in New York now so you

240
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,200
can actually take a look look at this

241
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
from a bit of a distance how how does

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Minneapolis hold up well yeah I mean not

243
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,040

244
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,800
greatest comedians but I've also toured

245
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,600
around to all the other you know great

246
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,440
cities and and Minneapolis definitely um

247
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,519
you know we don't in like Cincinnati do

248
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,480

249
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,959
Minneapolis man oh we oh my God we pound

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Cincinnati on the bottom really yeah

251
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,519
Cincinnati could suck it yeah I didn't

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
know how dirty I could go with that why

253
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,600
don't I say it leav it to your

254
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,480
imagination that's why I said on the

255
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,519
bottom but Cincinnati is about as bad as

256
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,880
it gets um no they're actually they're

257
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,160
actually decent we're just way better

258
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,800
than them um but uh thank you but you

259
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,680
know people recognize you know we're we

260
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,040
obviously don't leave very often we're

261
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
still here after the crap that's

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,200
happened in the last week yeah we have

263
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,040
no idea how we're perceived especially

264
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,040
as a comedy City but you're saying we're

265
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,880
actually held with it at least bit of

266
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,760
aam it's well I mean Louis Lee at Acme

267
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,920
um I call him comedy Yoda CU you know

268
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,760
he's like 55 and he just you know and he

269
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,880
looks like Yoda he's he's the manager

270
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,560
he's the manager he's the owner of Acme

271
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,920
and um and everybody here is familiar

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,600
with Acme everybody's been to Acme I

273
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,600
assume on a number of

274
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,040
OCC well he basically develops Talent

275
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
you know I mean most club Owners don't

276
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
care like they're just there to sell

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
liquor and he actually cares about the

278
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
quality of the content that's on stage I

279
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
mean he's a guy that will bring in

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,480
comedians that are sort of up and coming

281
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,000
and and uh you know and and like the

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,519
fans at Acme aren't trained on like get

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,320
her done kind of humor they're trained

284
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,519
to like when when you have a a funny

285
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
joke that you actually have to think

286
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,800
about uh those fans are going to like

287
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
that joke but if you went up there and

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,320
you're like men are different than women

289
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,600
they'd be like okay yeah we've heard

290
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,120

293
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,480
Discerning crowd and um and you know

294
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,639
it's basically because of Lewis that

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320

296
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,760
