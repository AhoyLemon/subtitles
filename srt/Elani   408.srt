a couple seconds

76

but real real quick right now here's

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,160
something we threw together for you

78
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,440
guys I'd like to have an

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,440
army my very own

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,039
Army I could train them myself show them

81
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,039
some

82
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,720
discipline if I had an army I'd stand on

83
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,360
a DS and salute them as they marched by

84
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,919
salute would just be for show though I'm

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
the real boss

86
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,320
here I bet chicks would dig me if I had

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
an

88
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,759
army I could get girls to sleep with me

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,759
when they see how other men carry out my

90
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,320
orders and if they play hard to get just

91
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:21,319
have their Village bombarded by my

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,319
Army yeah having my own Army would

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,919
rule some people think having a big army

94
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,840
is just compensation for something else

95
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,720
and I don't see it that way I like the

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,639
idea of having a long hard ship I can

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,280
take into port or a big round bulbous

98
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,479
bomb that I can drop into some dark hole

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't see anything Freudian about

100
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:52,720
that my Army would be so big I mean God

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
it would just be so enormous H there' be

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
soldiers who hadn't even seen above my

103
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
waist I'd have to put my picture up in

104
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,080
the town square just to remind everybody

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,039
who's in charge

106
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,199
here best part about my Army when I'm

107
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,240
out on a date and some chicks like whose

108
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,560
Army is that and I'd be like that Army

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,080
it's my Army and they'd be like wow no

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,680
way and I'd be all oh you know it and

111
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,199
then they'd go you must have an enormous

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,880
penis and then she'd sleep with me and

113
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,840
then everybody would see that I could

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,840
satisfy a woman too

115
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,599
I could totally have my own Army if I

116
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,199

we're coming back with more laning

345
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,279
the wood spider is the most accomplished

346
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,360
of all Web building

347
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,680
species recently scientists gave these

348
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,040
tiny creatures a variety of psychoactive

349
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,759
drugs to observe their effects on Web

350
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,680
building when given a minute dose of LSD

351
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,920
the spiders web took on an unfamiliar

352
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,959
minimalist

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,040
structure when given caffeine the web

354
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,839
structure was not affected but the

355
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,839
spider's Behavior was

356
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:08,280
given THC the active ingredient in

357
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,120
marijuana the spider didn't build a web

358
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,160
it built a hammock where it lay all day

359
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:19,120
and watched the caffeine spider

360
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,480
go when given alcohol the spider built a

361
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,799
web found a mate and raised over a 100

362
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,679
young but the mate got a restraining

363
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,840
order and now the spider can't go within

364
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,840
100 cm of the

365
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,880
web the crack cocaine spider figured

366
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,480
building webs was for suckers waited

367
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,799
till the caffeine spider was exhausted

368
