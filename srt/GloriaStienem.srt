thank you how is a book tour that's a

50
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,399
very grueling thing I would think it is

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,040
very grueling but part of it is also

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
terrific which is meeting with people

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
just you know it's like sending out a

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,879
signal a kind of big populous signal and

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
anybody who wants to come comes to the

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,400
bookstores or wherever we're having the

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,040
know it turns into an organizing meeting

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,680
I get to learn a lot because the

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,239
audiences are incredibly smart mhm so

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,519
what have you learned tell us Gloria

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,519
steum has learned in our state here in

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,879
the Twin Cities well uh well I come here

64
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,840
a lot and I I really have a lot of

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,599
respect for the degree of involvement

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,480
here you know people citizens really

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,000
seem to be involved in making social

68
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,599
policy and uh it seems like you have the

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
best and worst of everything here you

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
have the ultra right-wing leadership and

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,640
you have the you know most enlightened

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
leadership you you have a little of both

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,319
right right but um but I think there are

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
a lot of social policies here that

75
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,800
people could benefit from learning about

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,480
in the rest of the the country I mean

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
you You' you've got more understanding

78
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,319
say of domestic violence I noticed that

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,879
from the questions that have been coming

80
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,920
out coming in you know to stations and

81
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,799
so on about the OJ Simpson case um

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,599
you've got I it feels like you've got

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,040
better programs for senior citizens

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
these senior highrises and so on where

85
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,519
people can live and just a general sense

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,720
that if you if you work at it together

87
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,720
you can change whatever the social

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,560
policy is right right and we are leading

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,120
the country in that aspect it's talking

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,239
about all the different things let's

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
start talking about what is feminism

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
feminism is just what it says in the

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,319
dictionary which means the belief I

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,400
would say the fact but anyway the belief

95
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,519
that women and men are full social

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,400
economic political equals MH how did you

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
get involved with the fight of feminism

98
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,319
I got born a

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,920
female but actually I shouldn't say it

100
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,079
that easily because it took me a long

101
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,319
time to realize that the position of

102
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,159
women wasn't due to Nature you know or

103
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,159
God or biology or somebody and it wasn't

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,560
until I was in my middle 30s when the

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,200
movement really came along as women came

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,760
out of the or from the civil rights

107
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,759
movement and the anti-war movement

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
realizing that if even in those very

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,520
idealistic and good movements there

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,000
still wasn't male female equality we

111
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,680
probably also needed uh an autonomous

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,120
women's movement mhm is is that a

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
reality is that something I mean at one

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,080
time there's such awareness for feminism

115
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,000
there's a lot of fight and pushing going

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,919
on has feminism become p a oh not at all

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,240
it's become much bigger deeper wider I

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,039
think the reason it seemed like you

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,680
heard about it before was that it was a

120
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,720
kind of novelty you know so you used to

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,240
there would be like six or 12 crazy

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,440
people in each town that the Press would

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,639
cover from time to time but now it's

124
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,840
part of everything it's it's part of the

125
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,919
discussion of welfare it's part of any

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,800
discussion of unemployment it's part of

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,800
discussions of how we raise our kids

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,880
what goes on in schools and so it's no

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,400
longer just one strange thing it's

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
really become more part of of the fabric

131
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,240
of our lives but hasn't like the issue

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,880
of AIDS and the poverty and stuff that's

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,080
going on around the world hasn't that

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,199
lesson everyone's like after money

135
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,120
nowadays as opposed of really being

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,120
aware of these social changes that need

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,000
to take place in our society well but

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,319
all of those things must be looked at as

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,720
if women mattered as much as men because

140
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,360
for instance um the in New York at least

141
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,039
I don't know about here but women are

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,199
the fastest growing AIDS population

143
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,800
because it wasn't perceived that you

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,560
know what women's problems were that

145
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
they really didn't necessarily have the

146
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,919
power to insist that their male Partners

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,319
use condoms for instance or that they

148
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,240
were not knowledgeable about the lives

149
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,240
of their

150
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,360
Partners um you not not to mention all

151
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,880
the the problems that come from less

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,600
good medical treatment having to take

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,440
care of kids and so on even while

154
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,919
they're sick I mean there are all kinds

155
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,560
of tragedies now that are especially

156
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,120
tragic because the women who have AIDS

157
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,919
have the major responsibility for

158
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,720
children so whatever the problem is we

159
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,880
just need to look at it as if everybody

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,919
mattered not not just as if a few people

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
mattered right right what was the Equal

162
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,840
Rights Amendment well the Equal Rights

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,000
Amendment was this strange idea that

164
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,080
women uh should be included in the

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,919
Constitution as much as anybody else you

166
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,960
know so it would have made sex as

167
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,160
unconstitutional a basis for

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,840
discrimination as national origin

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,520
religion and race now

170
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,599
are uh I I'm sure that eventually we

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,360
will have it really you still think so

172
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,319
well yes I think the Constitution should

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,319
eventually include

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,560
me yeah no I think so but it it was um

175
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,280
it was a great loss because we were

176
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,039
within only three states of getting it

177
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,039
ratified the problem is that the state

178
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,720
legislatures in many states don't

179
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,879
represent the people the um the 14th

180
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,879
Amendment and the anti-slavery

181
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,759
amendments were only ratified by some

182
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,360
states in the 60s you know I mean you

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,800
know some of these states are really far

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,039
be we're talking Major League far behind

doing Gloria good good oh my my my my my

273
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,360
now we're talking about the different

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
issues of feminism what is what do

275
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,480
feminists think of

276
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,279
pornography well pornography the very

277
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
word means writing about female slaves

278
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,160
por means female slave so it's very

279
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,639
different from erotica because that is

280
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,240
Aeros love has some idea of of equal

281
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,279
choice and mutual pleasure so the two

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,199
it's it's like saying what's the

283
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,880
difference between sex and rape right

284
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,839
you know that's really the difference

285
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,120
between pornography and erotica you have

286
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,040
you had a relationship with Playboy

287
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,320
though you did some things with them I

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,560
did I worked as a bunny for I don't know

289
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,160
a month or so a long time ago in order

290
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,399
to expose the working conditions which

291
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,560
are lousy okay but when you turn 50

292
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,560
didn't you put another outfit on and

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,399
poed again with them oh no no where did

294
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,839
I hear that from no no definitely not

295
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,800
okay no so you are anti-p porn then

296
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,440
feminism there are some feminisms that

297
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,320
are saying that it's okay well I think

298
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,760
that I think the point is first of all

299
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,880
what are we talking about when we talk

300
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,120
about pornography but also that nobody

301
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,440
is talking about

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,079
censorship the the most that has ever

303
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,560
been proposed was here in the Minnesota

304
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,360
ordinance which would have uh said that

305
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,839
after something has already been

306
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,959
published if it can be demonstrated to

307
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,440
the satisfaction of a jury that it that

308
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,160
it contributed to a crime uh or

309
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,360
inhibited somebody's civil rights or you

310
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,399
know whatever which a crime then uh

311
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
civil damages could be posed but it was

312
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,440
never about prior restraint it's not

313
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
about censorship okay do you think an

314
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
image of Someone Like A Madonna you

315
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,800
think that's good for women or well I

316
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,040
think that she took the images or or

317
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,120
symbols of marn Monroe that had been

318
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,360
victim symbols and took control of them

319
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,839
and used them in a in a more powerful

320
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,240
way I don't think it's the goal but I

321
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,959
think it was a step forward you know for

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
because she clearly is in control of her

323
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,639
own life in fact you mentioned Marilyn

324
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,240
you wrote a book to text that Marilyn

325
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,120
Mar wrote book you met Marilyn I met her

326
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,639
once when I was in college yeah and she

327
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,440
was at the actor

328
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,279
studio um you know she sure made me like

329
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,040
everyone else you know want to take care

330
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,519
of her she was so vulnerable and so

331
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,000
sad sad story talking about someone at

332
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,320
the photo opposite as Jim Brown Jim

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,880
Brown in his book said that he had he

334
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,920
knew you you guys dated or something

335
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,199
like that yeah I wrote a story about him

336
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,839
that uh You' go back and find and New

337
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,079
York Magazine okay uh and we went out a

338
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,279
few times after that yeah good person

339
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,800
well you you know see I don't think of

340
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,360
Gloria Steam and Jim Brown together it

341
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,120
doesn't seem like well you know I we're

342
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,959
friends and and you know

343
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,360
he treated me fine and I treated him

344
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,959
fine and but I got worried about the way

345
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,399
he treated other women okay okay well

346
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,399
tell us about the new book the new book

347
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,800
is called moving beyond words uh yes and

348
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,560
it's it's really six books in one sort

349
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,880
of an odd format but just happened that

350
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,720
way so it's six books for the price of

351
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,720
one look at it that way okay okay and

352
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,920
there's everything in there from a very

353
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,279
outrageous piece called what if Freud

354
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,279
were Phyllis which is doing a sex change

355
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,800
operation on Sigman Freud and trying to

356
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,199
show the ways in which his theory is

357
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
crazy which you can especially show if

358
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,240
you reverse it you know if you say well

359
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,319
of course Anatomy is Destiny men are

360
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,759
incurably narcissistic and fragile

361
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,680
because they have genitals on the

362
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,160
outside and you know I mean I mean I

363
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,279
just reversed everything so you could

364
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,800
see how crazy it was uh to another piece

365
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,600
about the strongest woman in the world

366
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,079
this fabulous woman named Bev Francis

367
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,759
who's stronger than Arnold schwarzen

368
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,440
egger and I think really shows us that

369
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,639
we haven't even begun to explore uh

370
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,399
women's strength and muscles and so on

371
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,720
because unfortunately fat cultures I

372
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,000
mean Rich cultures value skinny women

373
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,600
and poor cultures Value fat women but

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,800
all male dominant cultures value

375
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,800
weakness in women and she's you know

376
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,240
really giving us a way out of that

377
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,680
there's there are pieces about all big

378
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,240
things in our lives aging the economy

379
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,079
the class system trying to walk around

380
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,959
them and look at them as if women

381
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,800
mattered so that we can really take them

382
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,920
on in our own lives in a creative way MH

383
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,120
and now you're approaching you're

384
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,639
approaching 60 now no I had my 60th

385
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,800
birthday March March 25th right right

386
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,040
well now you looking at life now as

387
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,079
coming into your mature years are you

388
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,680
going to start voicing opinions and

389
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,079
articles about a woman that's in her 60s

390
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,720
in the 1990s yeah I think so because

391
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,880
there's a whole part of life that nobody

392
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,160
prepared me

393
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,839
for at least everybody told me it was

394
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,640
sort of a decline or was downhill and

395
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,039
it's not it's very interesting it's

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,799
quite exciting because for one thing

397
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,559
what happens especially to women is that

398
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
you sort of become yourself you know I

399
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
mean because the female role is over so

400
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,120
you don't have to be a female

401
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,080
impersonator anymore which which women

402
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:36,400
are you know and and uh you can become

403
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,120
you can go back to that 8 n 10 yearold

404
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
you know strong little girl you used to

405
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,440
be only now you can reach the light

406
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,039
switch and you have your own

407
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,559
apartment and it's it's it's infinitely

408
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,120
interesting and I wasn't prepared for

409
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,400
that so I would like younger readers to

410
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,039
know what I didn't know you know which

411
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,120
is there is this whole interesting time

412
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,760
of life and you don't have to worry so

413
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,520
much about earlier years or settling

414
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,520
down or we never settle down it turns

415
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,520

441
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,760
want to say something that I say in the

442
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,760
book but in case you don't get the book

443
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,919
I okay that I think that the whole

444
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,559
country you ought to be very grateful

445
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,280
for this Paradigm of coming out that the

446
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,000
gay and lesbian movement has given to

447
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,240
everyone because it is the most powerful

448
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Paradigm of coming out as your true self

449
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,360
whoever that is and you know in the book

450
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm talking about that about people who

451
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,840
lie about their ages you know which is

452
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,400
like passing used to be you know or um

453
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,559
what whatever it is the ways in which

454
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,880
we're made to feel

455
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,000
unacceptable it's it's inspirational

456
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,200
that Paradigm and and I think we all

457
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,640
need to realize what a gift it is all

458
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,640

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,080
only positive thing that I can imagine

548
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,120
coming from this tragedy is that the

549
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,200
country may get educated on how common

550
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,279
the sexual abuse of women is I mean more

551
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,320
women were battered last year than had

552
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,120
children last year wow uh and this case

553
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,200
is unusual only because it's typical do

554
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,080
you know what I mean I mean if if he

555
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,840
weren't famous it would be basically the

556
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,120
typical typical case um he had the

557
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,279
violence had escalated I mean there was

558
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,559
uh what eight occasions I think on which

559
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,760
the police had been called to the house

560
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,240
she said that he was going to kill her

561
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,640
she told you know many people that and

562
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,480
yet it wasn't taken seriously enough for

563
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,320
him to be actually jailed and act

564
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,279
actually get treatment uh also his

565
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,480
letter to the Press was typical you know

566
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,559
because it didn't have anything in it

567
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,240
about her it was all about himh it was

568
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:24,080
all about feel sorry for me MH he even

569
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,080
referred to himself as as battered
