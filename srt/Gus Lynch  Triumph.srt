weren't for my wife you know our wives

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,280
guys right they really I think anywhere

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,759
out there you find a man struggling to

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,159
do his best uh you're going to find a

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,640
good woman standing right by his side

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,840
whispering in his ear that he's a piece

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,200
of

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,799
[ __ ] that's been my experience the guy

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,040
doesn't even need to be struggling for

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,560
her to say that it's the way it

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,399
goes I've been married for 15 years I

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,840
wouldn't trade it for the world you know

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,079
I have single friends my age they're

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,520
running around in the bars chasing after

47
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,840
tail living a life of

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,680
desperation I watch these guys get shot

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,320
down by a different woman every night no

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,640
thanks and as a married guy it is so

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,840
nice to know that you have that special

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,520
someone waiting at home to reject all

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,599
your clumsy sexual

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,560
advances cuz I would think hearing the

55
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,319
word no come out of a new mouth every

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,560
night that would get depressing in a

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,239
hurry I think but when it's the same

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,760
woman night in and night out for 15

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,920
years kind of comforting in a sad sort

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,560
of way I think I know exactly where I

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,680
stand you know like I I don't know if

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,879
familiarity breeds

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,280
attempt but I'm pretty sure it doesn't

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
make her

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,239
wet I mean after all my wife she's the

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,599
person who knows me better than anyone I

67
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,720
could hardly blame her for not wanting

68
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,519
to mag me that makes sense doesn't it

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,720
you break it down why would you bang

70
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,040
that

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,280
person and I don't begrudge my single

72
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,760
friends their freedom I really don't

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,360
here's what I don't like those single

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,760
guys I don't like it when you do somehow

75
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,760
manage to convince a stranger to go home

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,200

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,280
high degree of difficulty you know like

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,239

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,680

84
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,760
hang out with a lot of [ __ ] but

85
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,680
that's a separate

86
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,920
issue but yeah they're always saying

87
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,799
like oh I scored you know why cuz I got

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,200

her I don't know like

185
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,039
quarterly that's the game

186
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,720
[ __ ] that's the

187
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,840
game I got a great marriage with my wife

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,280
I really do and I think it's because we

189
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,319
both look at our marriage in the same

190
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,360
way uh we do not look at our marriage as

191
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,240
a journey through life together that's a

192
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,240
little fruity for me and my wife frankly

193
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,800
now we look at it as a battle to the

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,400
death win or take all very competitive

195
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,360
marriage somebody is going to win this

196
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,080
marriage we both agree that a good

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,919
marriage is one where you love support

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,519
and care for your partner with

199
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,760
everything you got while also

200
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,720
simultaneously trying to drive them

201
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,760
[ __ ] insane for the rest of their

202
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,839
lives

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,360
right and so you got to keep score you

204
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
got to know who's winning no point and

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,040
play in the game if you don't know who's

206
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,200

marriage Cu uh well here's what I

236
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,720
believe I believe that one of the

237
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,760
primary goals in marriage for women is

238
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,200
to convince the man to give her

239
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,680
babies I think one of the primary goals

240
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,399
for men in most marriage is to convince

241
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,320
the woman into giving him

242
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,440
[ __ ] now uh my wife and I have two

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,800
children so our marriage is locked in a

244
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
dead tie
