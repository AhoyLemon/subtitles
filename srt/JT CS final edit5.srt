way kind of strange like 50 something

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,840
year old woman and she looks at me and

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,160

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,759
all so I'm still happy to be here but

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,159
God damn it that was a rough way to end

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,720
a 14-hour trip how'd you get into comedy

29
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,240
I got into comedy uh being basically a

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,000
George Carlin fan growing up in New York

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
and when I was 16 I went on stage at

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
standup New York City for the first time

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,119
ever uh it was a total bringer show one

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,200
of those like Hey kid you got you got

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,479
the thing you got five FRS friends I'm

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,640
like I got five friends and I did that

37
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,720
twice and figured out it was a scam uh

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,720
but I was like I got a gig at age 16 I'm

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,360
a comic no uh and then I was doing other

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,079
things like radio and putting on punk

41
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,960
rock shows for a long time so 2008 I

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,640
started this thing called the

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,880
altercation Punk Comedy Tour and it's

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,159
all been a a steady uh work in progress

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,159
since

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,159
then the new album is called missing

47
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,119
thrope it's uh my latest hour this one

48
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,520
is all me um it was filmed in Dallas at

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
a place called Three Links which is one

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,920
of my favorite rock venues in the

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,000
country and uh was filmed last summer it

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,000
came out in August of

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,160
2016 and it's uh basically an hour of me

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,200
kind of ranting and raving about the

55
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,120
kids today and just kind of my old man

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,879
Persona I'm I'm slowly going from a a

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,120
youthful punk rocker filled with angst

58
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,160
to kind of a 40-year-old get off my lawn

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,840
guy filled with angst so it's a little

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,319
bit more worldly I think and it's not

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,599
just a CD right no it's the audio CD in

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,519

material and behind the scenes Mania

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,640
from all those people that I just said

85
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,959
you can't afford not to buy this it's

86
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,959
it's practically giving itself

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,840
away so every comedian has a podcast and

88
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,439
people have been asking me forever to to

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
start one so last summer I finally did

90
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,400
uh but I intentionally dragged feet

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,760
because I didn't want it just to be

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,599
comedians talking to comedians about

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,200
comedy because the world does not need

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,760
that so I uh I started something called

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,560
the road podcast.com and uh I was amazed

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
that the road podcast hadn't been taken

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,720
yet I don't know how I hit the jackpot

98
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,360
on that so it's a mix of comedians

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,799
there's a lot of comedians on it but

100
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,280
there's also a lot of musician folks

101
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,159
that I you know know and love people

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,319
like Mike Watt we had Dinosaur Jr on it

103
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,000
not that long ago Rollins has been a

104
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,599
guest on it uh swans you know just

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,560
really alt underground cool stuff and uh

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
also things that have no comedy related

107
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,239
whatsoever that just wild stuff you see

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,239
on the road I went to the thing in Texas

109
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,879
called The Snake Farm which is exactly

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,040
what it sounds like just a roadside Zoo

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
where they have like a 12T king cobra

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,680
and I just talk to like you know the guy

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,240
who feeds whole chickens to alligators

114
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,199
and [ __ ] like that I live in a

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
