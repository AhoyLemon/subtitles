1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,080
I always wanted to be an artist when I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
was a kid but I I just lacked the uh

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,080
confidence early on to go for it and

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,639
living in this city and being under the

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,799
influence of how cool this town is I

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,640
really decided to go for it and become

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,530
an artist and make my living at Art and

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,960
um that was that was my big defining

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:29,439
[Music]

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,559
moment I never felt like I fit in

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,900
anywhere I was always like an odd duck

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,160
in the

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,960
[Music]

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,039
pond as soon as I discovered Austin I

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,440
felt at home immediately and then when I

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,079
moved here I always kind of likened

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,480
Austin to like the uh the island of the

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,320
misfit toys you know it's like this is

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,480
the the land of the Misfits where all

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,559
the Misfits come and where they all fit

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,559
in

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,920
together I'd probably be the the saddest

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,440
diesel mechanic in Houston if if there

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,440
wasn't an

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Austin the American neon sign is unlike

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,799
any other neon sign anywhere in the

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,880
world some of the First cartoons that

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,080
anyone ever saw was actually neon signs

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,119
that were animated they'd never seen

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,119
cartoon images in motion

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,520
before in college I just really started

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
falling in love with the glow of neon

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,600
the gra Graphics behind it and the

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,320
weathering of it and how they reflected

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,360
the American Spirit of the 20th century

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,159
you know they're they're just big

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,680
audacious you know over-the-top graphic

38
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,520
images with dancing tacos or whatever

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,760
you know and I just I just more and more

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,040
fell in love with

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,479
[Music]

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,119
it the proudest thing that I could say

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,280
about my professional life is that I

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,799
make my living at Art I feed my family

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,080
by being an artist and and that's like

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,920
the ultimate in living this life to me

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,680
is actually making a living by creating

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,959
things out of my imagination and being

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,000
an artist it it's it's the most it's the

50
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,080
scariest and most amazing awesome

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,120
feeling in the world to take that leap

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
and scare the hell out of

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,239
yourself if you're living your life

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,599
where you scare yourself a lot that's

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
really living you know a lot of people

56
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,280
live like if they play the safe bank and

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,519
don't color outside the lines that

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,080
they're going to live forever and you're

59
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,000
going to die anyway whether you take the

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,879
chances or not you're still not getting

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,640
out of here alive so you might as well

62
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,420
scare the crap out of yourself and do

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,700
things that really are important to

64
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,700
[Music]

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,519
you I could not imagine myself doing

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,480
anything else in fact if I uh just

67
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,799
inherited a million dollars tomorrow I'd

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,239
come into work there's no way I'd ever

69
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,959
do anything else besides this I can't

70
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,519
this is what I love to do this is what

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:20,640
my life work is and I feel a a sense of

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,159
responsibility to uncover all of the old

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
neon technology and apply it to my art

74
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,959
and that's that's what I'm going to do

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
in my

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,000
life I want to make art that when you

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,720
die your kids fight over it you know I

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,959
mean I want something that that that

79
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,959
lives a lot longer than

80
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,480
me my dad always told us whatever you do

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,840
try to be the best at it and I feel like

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,239
I am the best at what I do creating

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,239
vintage style neon signs as fine art
