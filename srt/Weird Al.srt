it hits dust man now so now you like you

99
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,159

songs for the radio station yes how does

101
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,680
now a lot people radio DJs do that how

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,439
do you do that from a local radio

103
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,120
station and make it to a commercial

104
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,760
success uh well I was getting airpl uh

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
nationally through the Dr Demento radio

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,120
show he he was on a couple hundred radio

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
stations and he's still doing quite well

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,600
around the country uh and uh I got a lot

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,720
of exposure on that and became kind of a

110
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,959
cult figure uh on the show and uh got

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,160
kind of a a fan base and then started

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,759
hitting the record companies over the

113
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,520
head with a piece of salami until they

114
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,960
sign me okay and the next hit that you

115
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,919
had come out was Another One Rides the

116
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,199
Bus uhhuh and that was a big hit which

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,919
was of course the song uh a parody of

118
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,520
another one uh bites the D called

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
Another One Rides the Bus right what was

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
it about song parodies why did you pick

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
song parodies as your vehicle for your

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,080
music um it was just kind of a accident

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,160
almost I was I something i' done since I

124
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,360
was 12 years old and uh just made fun of

125
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,919
the songs on the radio I think I think

126
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,639
most people go through that stage it

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,560
only lasts a couple weeks but in my case

128
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,919
I'm still going through it mhm so you're

129
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,479
12 what was the first song You parody at

130
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,120
12 oh boy I I I have a big mental block

131
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,639
about that they're pretty bad they're

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,800
pretty bad they're pretty bad see the

133
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,560
thing that's really unique about your

134
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,919
songs they've held up so well over time

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,199
and I think part of the reason is is

136
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,960
because they are so good you know my

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
balona means as much to me today as it

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,639
did 15 years ago it's still it's a

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,479
Timeless song it is it's has something

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,360
to say to everybody uh do you write all

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,800
your own lyrics yes I do now the big hit

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,360

143
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,280

154
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,880
difficult because people didn't want to

return phone calls from some guy named

156
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,160

location here at the State Theater with

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,479
the wonderful talented wacky Weird Al

221
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,120
Yankovich yes we are he tell the truth

222
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,800
oh man yeah he's getting it right you're

223
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,639
getting much better I'm getting better

224
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,400
oh if I get better that'd be scarier o

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,039
that would scare me it would scare you

226
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,879
now on every album that you put out you

227
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,759
include original music on your album oh

228
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,720
yes it's about half original is is that

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
really important is that something that

230
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
you want to see happen comose from here

231
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,639
from my

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,080
pecs can I touch your pecs no oh okay

233
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,360
but the PEX is where it comes from yes

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
with the with the with the original

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
music is but that's what you want you

236
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,399
want to pursue that more well no I mean

237
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,919
uh I I like doing the parodies and I I

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
like the idea of having like a kind of a

239
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,680
50-50 mix with the originals and the

240
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,399
parodies um and the the originals are

241
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,720
hopefully funny uh as well uh I just

242
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,000
wish they'd be a little bit more popular

243
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,959
because to this day people say you know

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,200
the parodies are funny but you ever

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,880
think about writing your own music right

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,519
and then I have to hurt them badly

247
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
really see I mean in the music

248
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,480
profession of course it's known for the

249
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,519
one hit wonders like that they're gone

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,720
you make a hit and you're gone you

251
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,640
disappeared you're gone but you've had

252
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,240
longevity I think with parody I would

253
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,399
expect it maybe one hit if you got lucky

254
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,600
maybe two but you've had longevity I'm a

255
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,760
freak of nature yeah it it was actually

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
very difficult for me to get signed to a

257
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,160
record deal because uh what I do is

258
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,040
considered novelty music which is kind

259
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,959
of a derogatory term because it implies

260
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,600
one hit wonder because that that is

261
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,720
basically historically how it works

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,279
somebody will come along with a funny

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,800
song and it'll be a huge hit and then

264
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,440
you'll never hear from him again and

265
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,000
I've somehow managed to Buck the trend

266
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,279
and and you know have somewhat of a

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,920
career for close to 15 years what do you

268
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,399
attest to that um I eat from the four

269
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,839
basic food groups every day really

270
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,160
didn't as simple as that and I had all

271
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,519
the bones removed from my body

272
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,000
surgically really yeah see you know it's

273
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,040
very

274
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,399
yes okay now I guess I got to do

275
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,399
something

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,120
now oh my

277
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,959
Lord Weir now we're starting to get

278
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,480
where the name came from now I suppose

279
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,079
so the weirdo part what is a typical day

280
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,760
like for weirdo there is no such thing

281
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,760
as a typical day every day is special

282
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,040
and unique is that right this is the the

283
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,320
uniquest day I've ever had why is that

284
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
because of this interview this is the

285
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Pinnacle of my existence on this planet

286
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,480
this is the Apex this is the greatest

287
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,760
moment of my life sitting here talking

288
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,360
to you a lot of PE celebrities I've

289
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,399
interviewed it felt exactly the same way

290
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,839
that you

291
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,160

299
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,320
but I mean like when you go back to the

300
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,639
Dress room are you like a loner and you
