00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,879
hey everybody this is Ian um I'm talking

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,279
to you right now from my messy bedroom

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,080
here in Minneapolis Minnesota doing a

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,000
video blog thing which is I don't really

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,920
like doing cuz I think it's kind of

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,280
trendy well it was trendy a couple years

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,759
ago now it's just kind of I missed the

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,199
boat and I was lazy then and I had

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,320
better [ __ ] going on and well now I

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,000
don't unfortunately and the the gimmick

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,119
Still Remains so here I am anyway so um

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,920
about 4 days ago I decided um that I

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,920
wanted to get a bird feeder now that

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,640
might seem stupid to you Ian you're

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,079
probably saying to yourself you seem

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,879
like a somewhat together with it Guy

17
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,360
bird feeders are for the elderly well

18
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,920
you're right and um unfortunately I'm

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,680
not getting a younger myself but I'm

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
bored a lot of times so you know I sit

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,840
around I I do a lot of work in my room

22
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,760
in my messy bedroom that's why we're

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,480
here right now um you know I do stuff

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,160
you know I'm editing you know blah blah

25
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,680
blah and look at me I'm working right

26
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,280
now I actually have a Final Cut Pro open

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,559
uh was doing some editing but if you

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
notice right above that um I have a nice

29
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,199
window I actually kind of set this up to

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,719
uh you know my little editing area to to

31
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,320
uh be right by the windows so I can look

32
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,080
out you know like so it doesn't seem

33
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
like I totally wasted the day away and

34
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,200
every now and again I'm lucky enough to

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,320
get a couple Birds just to kind of hang

36
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
out there and they look at me and they

37
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,920
say hey in how you doing and I go hey

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,080
Tweet Tweet back at you little bird

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,479
friends but you know and then they then

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,400
they leave and then they got bird things

41
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,360
going on so finally after living here

42
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,079
for about 4 years I decided Well you

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,840
know what would be awesome why don't I

44
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,840
get a bird feeder and that is precisely

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,320
what I did about 4 days ago right over

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
here in this window right behind me

47
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,280
above my dirty air conditioner and this

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,799
was going to be great this was going to

49
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,119
be you know like it's not like you know

50
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,960
exactly my raison Detro not my reason to

51
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,000
live but I thought it would be you know

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,159
something new I could look at while I

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,159
wild the hours what precious gift of

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,159
Life Away um but but so far um I've had

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,079
a problem that problem being that I have

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,719
not had a a single [ __ ] bird show up

57
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,200
now it's been 4 days now I don't know

58
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,399
about you but if I if there was a big

59
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,640
pile of hamburgers sitting around my you

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,920
know neighborhood it wouldn't take me 4

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,840
days to find it I I would know pretty

62
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,400
damn quick that like holy [ __ ] there's a

63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,879
big pile of free food for the taking now

64
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,160
something I haven't told you is that I'm

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,040
I've been you know I'm 32 years old and

66
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,239
I've had I've had a multitude of jobs in

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,840
my life not the least of which is

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,000
graphic design done a lot of PR work too

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,920
in the past um and I honestly kind of

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,080
feel like a failure because I'm giving

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,000
away free food right there free food for

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
taking and there's a moth but that moth

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,319
isn't going to eat any but I'm giving

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,519
away free food to basically this uh bums

75
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,480
to Indigent hobo birds that really don't

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,840
have any better options in life at all

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,200
so I I'm being altruistic look at me I'm

78
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,920
cool look at me I'm a bleeding heart

79
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,599
liberal I got a [ __ ] bird feeder for

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,159
some [ __ ] birds birds don't want it

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,599
so I am setting up this video blog to

82
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,920
see what I need to do using my years and

83
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,159
years of

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,959
research and knowledge of uh public

85
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,080
relations um trying to get birds to show

86
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,480
up to this bird feeder I even bought

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,959
good food I don't want to think that I

88
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,640
like I skimped on this I didn't look I

89
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,720
got some Scots song bird mix now I'm

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
already regretting that because as you

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,000
might have ascertained you don't really

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,120
you might not know me very well but I

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
not a morning person so if I do get

94
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,480
birds here it might not last very long

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
so the last thing I [ __ ] want are a

96
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,159
bunch of loud birds but what I'm trying

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
to illustrate to you is that I actually

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,799
spent the money to get real seed from

99
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,480
our friends Menards who aren't

100
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,319
sponsoring this of course cuz why the

101
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,799
[ __ ] would they anyway but yeah so this

102
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,959
is a video blog Illustrated on what do I

103
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,400
need to do to get birds to show up to

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,120
this bird feeder thank you for watching

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,120
hopefully this will be good
