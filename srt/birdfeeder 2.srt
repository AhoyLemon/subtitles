00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,720
this is part one of what I'm calling the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,720
bird feeder

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,280
[Music]

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,039
Chronicles now it's not that good of a

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,320
name but this is only the first part

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,439
really I mean yesterday was kind of like

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,800
the introduction to the bird feeder

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,519
chronic so if you have a better idea

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
post it on a message on the Facebook or

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,000
whatever and you know we'll we'll take

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,560
it into consideration and by we I mean

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,440
me but I only if you have a better idea

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,200
I mean come on seriously so anyway um

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,000
the if you watched yesterday you know

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,320
that I've had a bird feeder then for 4

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,039
days and I had yet to have a single bird

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,399
well it is my unfortunate job to tell

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,199
you now that today is day five still yet

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
to have a single bird show up and just

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,079
depressing to me cuz I've been you know

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,239
you know I've been doing stuff around

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,440
town for quite a while and you know I

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,879
have a pretty good reputation people

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
generally show up to my stuff and I I

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,000
like I like to know that and I even

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,960
charge cover charge but I'm giving away

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,640
a big pile of food and the birds they

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,960
just aren't interested yet so I'm trying

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm thinking to myself I've given this

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,640
much thought much pondering and I'm like

32
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,240
okay well where are these birds from

33
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,840
well they're from Uptown well what do

34
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,320
they do in uptown well these birds they

35
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,040
hang out on telephone wires and kind of

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,479
hang out so I have decided to put

37
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,680
together a gorilla marketing campaign

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,040
aimed at today's bird my clientele so

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,400
I've come up with a name for my bird

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,240
feeder it's no longer just my bird

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,680
feeder now it is known as the cedy right

42
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,200
there so check it out right there pretty

43
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,040
cool huh I even did a logo for it and

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,640
everything it's not the best logo but

45
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,119
yet again we're early on this maybe

46
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,360
we'll s snaz it up later maybe I'll talk

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,439
to Olsson and Company or some

48
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,759
advertising agency if this really takes

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,200
off so I've come up with a couple ideas

50
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,799
here so check it out now this is stop

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
hanging around so that's what they do

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
and this is on a telephone poll so

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
trying to get right to them so stop

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,040
hanging around fly over to the cedar see

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
I've got a bird up there on a telephone

56
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,159
wire was thinking of Goldie Han Mel

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,280
Gibson thing but I decided against it

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
cuz that's kind of high brow for birds

59
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,880
and um always what you want to do when

60
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
you're advertising your wares what are

61
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,880
your wares well right here check it out

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,719
we have featuring today you know and I'm

63
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
trying to you know add urgency to that

64
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,479
so maybe tomorrow it'll be different

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
maybe we won't have as good of stuff

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,080
tomorrow we have sunflower chips white

67
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,080
Millet peanuts red millet and Canary

68
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,120
seed we have two different kinds of

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,360
millet I know and I even came up with a

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,920
little slogan seed is good H yeah see

71
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,879
maybe they remember Wall Street and you

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
know I'm generally kind of against word

73
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,959
playing stuff like that but you know

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,160
maybe birds are for it you know cuz dumb

75
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,720
people like puns a lot so you know birds

76
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,680
have little tiny brains so maybe they'll

77
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,400
be into seed is good that's the hope you

78
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,800
know I mean yet again stuff's free we're

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,959
giving it away I'm just kind of trying

80
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,280
to raise awareness for these birds cuz

81
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,560
these are hip up town birds like I'm

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,360
telling you man they got to know what's

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
going on so we're coming right to them

84
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,400
coming to my clientele now my clientele

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,480
might include different kinds of birds

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,920
and this is something I've have already

87
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,599
considered in addition to the two

88
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,319
different kinds of millet I have two

89
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,360
different kinds of advertising campaign

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,519
check this one out right here

91
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,760

94
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,040
believe to be a finch yet again

95
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,440
advertising the two different kinds of

96
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,120
millet we've got and yet again seed is

97
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,239

we've got what you need cuz let's face

100
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,040
facts today's active pigeon they're

101

hungry you know they've got better

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,360
things to do than sit around stand in

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,480
line man and there is no waiting at the

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,239
cedar now let's check out the location

105
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,640
shall we here we are right here behind

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,799
my house now let's take a look up there

107
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,519
now you see okay there's the sign for

108
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,799
the cedar I'm a little out of focus but

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,000
you can kind of get the idea I hope and

110
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,239
up there is the bird feeder the cedy

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,720
this is it this is our local this is our

112
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,400
location so birds get with it here we

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
are day five still no birds but now we

114
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,560
have a very aggressive advertising

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,920
campaign that I think speaks to today's

116
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,680
bird and uh by the way yesterday I did

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,720
the uh I posted the video on Facebook

118
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,439
didn't help attendance at all so maybe

119
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,280
they're still on MySpace maybe they're

120
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,560
still on Friendster see Ste you can even

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
hear them mocking me right now but I

122
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
don't know so maybe they're but they're

123
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,519
out there they're doing something but

124
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,680
they're not checking Facebook so if you

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,320
have any sort of uh Aven thing you're

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
trying to put out there Facebook not a

127
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,960
good solution but hopefully Gorilla

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,560
Marketing is so we're going to check in

129
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,600

130
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,220
