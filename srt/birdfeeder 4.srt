00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,920
hey everybody this is Ian um all right

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,000
so here's the deal I'm here in my

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,000
bedroom and it's now been a week or so

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,400
since we've actually since I've hung the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
bird feeder and we still have yet to

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,279
have ner a single bird show up so I have

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,480
decided to do what many other failed

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:29,359
Ventures have done I have decided to do

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,200
an open mic night here in my bedroom

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,920
kind of get some excitement here and it

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,079
is my pleasure it is my utmost Duty

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,490
ladies and gentlemen to welcome up the

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,000
one and the only Patrick

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,680
[Applause]

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,520
Bower how's going how's going I uh

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,440
thanks I just flew in here from Toledo

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,440
and uh much like every other thing that

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,440
uh flies I failed to stop by the

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,960
feater I was saying now at weddings

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,440
apparently uh instead of rice they're

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,439
throwing out bird seed because uh rice

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,960
makes uh pigeons explode and um

24
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,680
apparently the government is not

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,200
throwing R everywhere on my block um the

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,600
add a benefit I guess to throwing bird

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
seed at the wedding is that you no

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,890
longer have to decorate the car that the

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,600
bride and groom drive drive off

30
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,840
[Laughter]

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,720
in and you know I've seen things like uh

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,720

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,119

hardest until you've slapped her because

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,680
really if you're not getting your

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,190
