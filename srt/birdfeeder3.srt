10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,080
have an update yesterday it was tough um

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,560
I was going through some hard times ran

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,759
around put up all these

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Flyers that was a lot of work and I

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,960
don't have much of a work at in the

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,360
first place so went up and down all the

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,280
alleys in my neighborhood put up some

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,520
flyers and I

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,160
got big goose egg right there zero

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,680
return which uh kind of ticked me off

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,640
and um made me a little sad made me a

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,239
little introspective um I actually made

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,640
a video for yesterday um I just didn't

23
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,160
bother putting it up um just in full

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,000
disclosure since this is like a video

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,760
blog thing and I'm kind of like a diary

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
put my insides on the outside um here's

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,200
a clip of uh what I did yesterday that I

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,200
decided not to upload

[Music]

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,119
okay well see that's what I'm talking

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,240
about right there I didn't want to put

36
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,640
it up because I don't know the quality

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,320
was kind of mediocre and it doesn't

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,600
really reflect well on me as a person so

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,920
I decided let's just skip it let's take

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,000
a day off come back today you know well

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,560
refreshed that's exactly what I did now

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
the bird Peter's been up there for about

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,440
6 days I think I don't know I'm kind of

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,400
iffy of math but in the spirit of Web

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
2.0 I have decided to be a little

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,080
interactive and take some suggestions

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,160
from you the viewer got some right here

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,440
now uh my friend hap from Texas she had

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,760
a really good idea she said hey Ian why

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,000
don't you sprinkle some seed outside

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,959
underneath the bird feeder so that's

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,640
precisely what I'm gonna do right

53
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,840
here yet again got the Scott song bird

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,200

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,200

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,840
around pretty good amount too might as

57
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,040
well be liberal with it otherwise it's

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,040
not going to get used at all you

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,159
know so we got some nice piles of uh

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,040

too um my friend Stephanie from New York

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,720
um she wrote in not technically a a

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,680
suggestion but she used the phrase bird

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,159
banal in her response um and that's a

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,159
colorful use of alliteration Stephanie

68
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,560
so um that degree being put to good use

69
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,799

generally on the fan settings so there's

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
no hot air coming out of there but
