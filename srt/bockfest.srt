00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,639
good I am hecton Klein vone documentary

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
filmmaker perhaps you Americans are

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,799
somewhat familiar with some of my films

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,240
including my latest award winning film

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,840
Holocaust what Holocaust which was very

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,199
well received in Iran about a year ago I

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,439
received a package anonymously through

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,439
the mail which contained five video

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,640
cassettes and a note Written in Blood

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,480
which simply read tell the people but

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,599
these tapes contained chilled me to my

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,239
very core and became the inspiration for

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,440
vacha about to see the footage

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,160
Chronicles a TV host attempting to make

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,960
sense of a yearly event known as

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,239
bachfest a drunken bakanal of such

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,719
staggering proportions that it makes

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,719
Carnival in Rio look like a school girl

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,879
slumber party I must warn you what you

20
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,480
are about to witness should not be seen

21
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:58,120
by the faint of heart the very young the

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,120
very old most women and some men you may

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,719
vomit in fear you may be driven insane

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,640
you may even abandon your God such is

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,520
the power of my films but one thing is

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,880
certain you will not be able to tear

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,040
your eyes

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,119
away here now is the tragic story of

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,119
drinking visan at B

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,240

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,360
location of Bo Fest in lovely new all

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,560
Minnesota it's being put on

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,039
by our friends at the Shell's Brewery

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,240
and judging by the sheer outpouring of

40
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,000
Jack acidness around me I assume these

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,000
people have already been

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,080
drinking it's like I'm waiting for Al

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,160

someing beer do you people like

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,160
beer it seemed a simple enough task to

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,280
undertake perhaps Ian was optimistic he

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,040
might find some Pearls of Wisdom or vity

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,319
banter from these cheerful beer soft

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,080
party people but it soon became clear

52
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,120
that something more Sinister was a foot

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,440

drunk with passion and a lot of beer he

152
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,080
became like a Savage man stocking his

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,560
prey how ever what began as a B hunt

154
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,759
soon became a fight for survival in an

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,960
unforgiving

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,720
Wilderness unable to rely on his vits

157
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,680
and very nearly sober medu became what

158
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,879

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,720
more you know Ian and I go back a long

235
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,240
way and I don't know if a lot of people

236
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,079
know this but Ian and I actually met in

237
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,839
jail and I knew that I was going to hit

238
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,360
it off with Ian right away he was the

239
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,399
only other guy in a clown suit and

240
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,240
despite the fact that he was a happy

241
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,480
clown I was a sad clown

242
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,160
that never became a wedge between us we

243
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,040
have been Fast Friends really ever since

244
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,720

246
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,279

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,520
means but anyway it was a good time we

628
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,039
we had a great time we drank a lot of

629
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,600

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,480
Ian was never heard from

634
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:39,200
again what became of him it is hot to

635
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,360
say there are rumors he was picked up by

636
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,360
a random truck driver ripped and eaten

637
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,480
but the locals tells the story of a man

638
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:53,399
who stalks the wooded CRS of the Shell's

639
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:58,960
Brewery subsisting on acorns and his own

640
00:27:53,399 --> 00:28:01,519
Ur eagerly awaiting the next B Fest

641
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,399

642
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,000
