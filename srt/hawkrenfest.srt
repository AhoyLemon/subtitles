columnist um a year and a half that's

328
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:44,880
why has your column become so

329
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
popular I guess because I have crazy

330
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,760
people calling me up and saying that

331
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
they're the best looking men in

332
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,519
community and then I should write about

333
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,120
them uhhuh I don't know it's really it's

334
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
really clicked where do you get your

335
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,440
information from crazy men who call me

336
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,720
and tell me that the best looking men in

337
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,480
come

338
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,480
and that I you know I need to do this or

339
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,920
I need to do that and so and after I get

340
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,360
these phone calls from these uh people

341
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,800
who've been abusing drugs

342
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
then then I try to find people who have

343
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,000
not been abusing drugs to confirm the

344
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,680
information that I heard how do you

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,199
confirm now when you write a source you

346
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,600
get like two sources before you put a

347
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,680
story in it depends on what the what the

348
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,000
item is but I try to get as close to the

349
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,639
actual Source uh of the information as I

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,160
can okay what happens when you get

351
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,600
something that's not right that you put

352
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,720
something misinformation in that does

353
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
happen oh yeah I try to correct it but

354
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,079
that's the nature of Gossip too and Liz

355
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,440
Smith I understand runs a correction

356
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,079
almost every column uhh and I don't have

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,880
uh my H stats aren't quite that bad

358
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,880
really okay okay how does that make you

359
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,639
feel that and in fact I ask you that

360
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,839
you've become a celebrity by writing

361
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,279
this column well it's almost as absurd

362
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,440
as you're being a

363
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,759
celebrity but not quite I don't know but

364
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,560

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
something that I'm interested in and I

370
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,320
don't often get to meet people who've

371
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,920
been growing a mustache as long as

what what did you write that got the

386
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,000
most response jez I don't know that's

387
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,480
hard to uh the the people at Mount oliv

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
are pretty irritated with me last lately

389
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
yeah I heard that thing on your answer

390
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
machine what did you say oh I don't

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,800
think we should repeat it was it wrong

392
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
no it wasn't wrong they have a a banquet

393
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,759
a Sportsman's banquet where the women

394
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,759
serve the men and the men honor other

395
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,120
sports male Sports people this year they

396
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,320
are reportedly going to honor a woman

397
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,519
but generally um it's just sounds kind

398
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,519
of discriminatory to me and uh it just

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,240
it's outdated let me serve you you you

400
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,120
don't like the idea of women serving men

401
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,160
so you better stay up

402
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,519
under you don't like that idea what's

403
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
wrong with that

404
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
well um I it just seems like it seems as

405
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
though the largest uh Lutheran

406
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,079
congregation in North America could do

407
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,800
something that would be more inclusive

408
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,319
of everyone and this sounds a little

409
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,319
exclusive well that's what see now you

410
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,639
said there's nothing wrong with that

411
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,959
that's your opinion yeah I have a ton of

412
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,000
them all right well I tell you what
