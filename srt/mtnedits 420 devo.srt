go insane with nothing to do and nowhere

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,799
to go they had to think of some fun that

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
didn't

64
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,920
blow so they went to the kitchen and

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,799
looked under the sink When Sally said

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,799
Billy I'd like to order a

67
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,439

started to swirl but it all had end when

75
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,840
Sally started to

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,239
hurl with the kitchen a mess they had

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,480
move on and look for some more fun that

78
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,239

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,760
just to explore Sally checked closets

80
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,319
while Billy checked drawers and under a

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,359

the window she splintered a chair but it

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
paid off when Geral exploded mid

91
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,960
a Sally turned kind of blue and she

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,639
started to pout when she aimed at Bill's

93
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,840
head and no ammo came out a gun with no

94
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,080
bullets well that is no fun what to do

99
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,160
the alley on their sweet merry way when

100
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,000
Billy said Sally hip hip hooray we could

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,800
play homeless for just pennies a day

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,759

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,360

104
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,680

from some passer by folks and got just

109
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,840
enough to buy themselves smokes and in

110
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:47,560
an old Warehouse in the bad part of town

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:51,160
they lit up their sigs and matches threw

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,080
down Billy said Sally let's see what can

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:18,319
his fiery jig laughing and singing the

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,599
Flames growing big his skin turned extra

122
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,759
crispy as the fire took toll he should

123
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,560
have remembered a stop drop and

124
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,319
roll they poked him with the stick to

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,880
look for his soul but the stick had

126
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,039
found none and it made a big hole as

127
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,440
their dance Partners smouldered Sirens

128
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,000

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,599
pumping they were catching a buzz and

131
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,080
searched for a spot they could hide from

132
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,280
the fuzz they scaled the link fence was

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,479
embed wire topping their feet hit the

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,800
ground and they ran without stopping and

135
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,240
into the junkyard they searched high and

136
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,280
low to find a swell spot where the pigs

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,560
wouldn't go we could hide in that Barrel

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,440
or that car over there that rusted out

139
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,879
loln that smells like burnt

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,560
hair then off in the distance it loomed

141
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,039
from afar a shiny Frost freeze with its

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,000
front door a

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,639

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,199
it they had to scrunch close it was a

145
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,919

mindes and Billy said Sally it's the

150
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,639
best place to hide and they closed the

151
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,840
door

152
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,840

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
strike and yeah speaking of uh scoring I

188
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,760
mean do directors just kind of set you

189
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
loose now I mean do you actually they

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,600
give you ideas are they giving you moods

191
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
or they because those guys you know you

192
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,120
figure a director might have been on the

193
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,320
film God maybe five years by the time I

194
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,519
get I get a copy of it they've already

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
pretty much they're pretty far into the

196
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,440
editing so it's like all the all the

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
really painful stuff is over um and how

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,600
has uh how has scoring changed your

199
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,160
outlook on instrumentation it's changed

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,079
a lot in the last uh 10 or 15 I think

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,079
it's more interesting that said my

202
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,800
favorite movies are black

203
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,480
I tend to watch a lot of AMC Turner

204
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Classic Movies oh yeah yeah yeah one of

205
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
the directors worked with is a big

206
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,519
dealer out here you know Chuck Statler

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,920
how did how' you meet him how'd that

208
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,640
come to be we were just starting you

209
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,000
know we we we were in this Amic

210
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,200
protozoic stage of dvo where we were you

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,120
I think we were even called the de

212
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,839
Evolution B we just decided we weren't

213
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,560
the de evolutionary Army anymore we were

214
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,360
dvo we cut all the letters off at the

215
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,079
end contracted it down to Doo and with

216
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,240
Chuck came and said he wanted to make a

217
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,519
film it really just clicked we knew

218
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,320
that's what we wanted to do films and

219
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,959
there was no such thing as MTV it wasn't

220
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,720
even talked about since he kind of

221
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,040
predicted the uh the birth of MTV did

222
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,120
you have any uh you know idea of how

223
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,839
horrible was going to become no it was

224
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,279
shocking how fast it became bad uh but

225
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
you guys did provide basically a

226
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,440
blueprint for MTV back in those early

227
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
days did you guys shoot anything that

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,279
you never used is there are there any

229
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,639
videos in the vaults uh one of the guys

230
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,040
that worked with us in the early these

231
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,560
two guys um Marty Raymond and Ed barter

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,800
and he shot maybe 30 hours maybe 30

233
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,360
different shows maybe more has odd

234
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,880
things on film like

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,959
uh dead boys jumping on to while we're

236
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,160
playing and getting in a fist fight with

237
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,920
us I think he has David Bowie coming on

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,360

239
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,680

Want to Hold Your Hand um for the

258
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,240
beginning of uncontrollable urge the

259
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,320

up and he he was at least one person in

263
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,680
the audience that noticed that because

264
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,160
he probably wrote that and he but but I

265
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,040
was sitting in the the van we were going

266
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,720
to be sleeping in that night and he

267
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,959
stuck his head in the window in a

268
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,560
drunken kind of sloppy voice say half of

269
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,160
uncontrollable urge to me from about

270
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,959
four inches away from my face and uh it

271
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,279
just it was a totally different thing

272
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,959
well yeah when you have a drunken John

the show and we went to Robert fr's

278
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
house and they were both fighting over

279
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,760
who would produce dvo it was it was a

280
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,920
different and we were like wait a minute

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,000
you guys should have been there last

282
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,600
week when we got our asses kicked at the

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Eagle Street Saloon in in in Cleveland

284
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,440
but pretty soon you know you can tell

285
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,800
those people the Eagle Street to go

286
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,440
themselves CU Divo just got really

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,360
really damn big who selling a lot of

288
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
albums and you know that breeds a lot of

289
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,920
copycats uh what do you think about all

290
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,279
those dvo clones that came out I like

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,360
the good ones and I don't like the bad

292
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,639
ones you know in a way we didn't really

293
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,360
own what we did we were just you know

294
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,519
come on bands music bands even

295
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,480
dvo uh are incredibly eclectic I mean it

296
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,040
it's it said it's most boring when when

297
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,240
somebody creates some new genre like

298
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,360
heavy metal or rap and yeah you know

299
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,320
like five years later you know the the

300
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
in the increments of innovation are

301
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,959
become smaller and smaller I remember

302
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,880
you know like at one point the the the

303
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,519
things that differentiated the bands

304
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,160
were so

305
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,040
minimal unimportant yeah and I don't

306
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,800
know it's it's it's a whole different

307
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,759
you have to think about the world of

308
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,279
music

309
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,079
and art and public art all differently

310
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,279
now because of the internet yeah because

311
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,120
it just I think uh nowadays it's just

312
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,560
harder work to find good stuff that's

313
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,000
the thing there's there's probably more

314
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,600
good stuff than there ever was but more

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,680
great music it's just really hard to

316
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,880
find because there's more crap in this

317
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,160
big cess pool called the internet

318
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,120
looking for it and you know it's like

319
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,720
you can have Nostalgia for the old days

320
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,040
