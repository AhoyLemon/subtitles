1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:01,045
I was talking about Chicago.

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:04,205
My other favorite place to do comedy is Eureka,

3
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:05,525
California and the Redwoods.

4
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:08,445
I like that s**t. I don't make a lot

5
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,125
of money out there, but I like the trees.

6
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:10,645
So

7
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:18,775
people say, you know, the walk

8
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,295
of shame is like when a cool lady has sex with you.

9
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:22,975
And then in the morning she leaves

10
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,615
and they say That's the W of shame.

11
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:28,015
That's not the w of shame man. I used to hate that s**t.

12
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:29,855
Women would come over and they'd be like, I'm leaving.

13
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,495
He's got 10 dogs. It's like, f**k you Jennifer.

14
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,495
You know? Yeah.

15
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,615
Think you're better than me. Hate that s**t.

16
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,175
I didn't have 10 dogs. Okay.

17
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,975
I had two dogs, but every time my dogs had run away,

18
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,415
they'd come back with another dog.

19
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,015
Um, you see what I'm saying?

20
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,335
Eight of those dogs were my dogs'. Dogs.

21
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:53,455
Um, I try to tell that to Jennifer.

22
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,775
She ain't even listening, you know?

23
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,615
Uh, I'm Sam Miller from Olympia Washington.

24
00:00:58,255 --> 00:00:59,255
Greatest town in the world.

25
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:02,175
All right. So you say it's the greatest town in the world.

26
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,695
Is that just fluffy, I mean, really?

27
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,175
Mm-Hmm. No, I've been everywhere man.

28
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:08,215
And I keep coming back to Olympia

29
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:10,135
'cause that's where my wife is.

30
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,975
Yeah. And my kids. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:18,215
I just love it. 'cause in Olympia I have one of everything.

32
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,455
You know I have a barber, I have a mechanic,

33
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,415
like all these beautiful people.

34
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,095
I hang out with a lot of musicians. I hang out with a lot.

35
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,855
I hang out with some poets, some painters

36
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,615
and a couple comedians.

37
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:31,975
Uh, and I'm very lucky.

38
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,415
Tell me about your first album. What's

39
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:39,415
This? Oh, first album,

40
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,575
first album's called Round Trip.

41
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:47,655
Recorded it at the Capitol Theater in um, April of 2023.

42
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:49,375
So recorded it almost a year ago now.

43
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,695
Um, or more than,

44
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,175
I don't even know, maybe it was more than a year.

45
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,775
I can't tell. I don't know how time works.

46
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,935
There's been a few moments in my life

47
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:58,175
where I've had real clarity

48
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,535
and one of those moments was watching Cops in jail

49
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,455
and giving these guys advice on TV

50
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,175
and realizing that I am in no place

51
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,535
to be given this man advice,

52
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,775
Considering my current predicament there.

53
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:14,655
And dude, man, yeah, I'm really proud of it.

54
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,775
It was funny, I was just hanging out with Dan, um,

55
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:20,255
the CEO deep guy and uh, we've become really good friends

56
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,335
and he was talking about some other comic

57
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:23,815
who says they hate their first album.

58
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,335
And I asked him if I was like,

59
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,135
do you think I'm gonna hate my first album?

60
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,335
And he goes, maybe someday.

61
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,095
But, um, I don't know if I'm gonna get that or not

62
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,455
because I'm really proud of that album.

63
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:37,735
I think it's pretty good. So I like, it's got a good arc

64
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,215
to it and it's got good jokes

65
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,935
and it's got solid laughs throughout

66
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,975
and I think I make some decent points here

67
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,775
or there without trying to, you know. Yeah.

68
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,375
And tell me about, you know, I mean since it was your

69
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,095
first album, you had your whole lifetime to write it.

70
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,215
What parts of your life definitely pop out of

71
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,215
The album? I mean, you're gonna

72
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,655
hear a lot, uh, homelessness,

73
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:56,335
incarceration, um, that's what I like to write about.

74
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,895
My, one of my favorite people in the world.

75
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,285
This dude named Gabe Rutledge, great comedian, you know,

76
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:04,085
he is also an Olympia, he told me a long time ago.

77
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:07,005
He is like, the best way to do standup is to talk about

78
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,325
what makes you laugh and then just

79
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:09,565
invite other people along.

80
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,165
And like, that's the s**t that me and my friends joke about.

81
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:14,605
We joke about crazy s**t. We joke about being locked up.

82
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,365
We joke about living outside

83
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,245
'cause it, that's the only way I could survive that.

84
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,525
And that's how I survived that.

85
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,005
Fans are also people that have been through a lot

86
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:25,965
of hard s**t and I don't, and I, I love them man.

87
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,285
It's, it's awesome. I get cool

88
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:28,605
messages from people all the time.

89
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,965
Standup doesn't have a monopoly on humor.

90
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,605
And um, to me humor is survival.

91
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:36,485
So like I was funny before I did standup

92
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,525
and I'd be funny if I stopped doing standup

93
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,925
'cause funny's funny, I'm a funny dude.

94
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:46,605
And then she told me that the CPAP machine I needed is

95
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:47,605
$1,500.

96
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,365
So I'm just waiting to die.

97
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:55,325
Like, I like my life, but I don't $1,500 like it.

98
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:56,845
God damn, that's a lot of money.

99
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:01,205
You can get a 2003 Kia Spectra of 1500 bucks.

100
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:06,045
I know. 'cause I bought a 2003 Kia Spectra.

101
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,685
Everybody's like, that's very specific. Yeah.

102
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,485
Some of these aren't jokes.

103
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,125
Touch a moment on how social media has affected

104
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,465
The game. Yeah, yeah.

105
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,805
Well,

106
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:21,005
people can think whatever they want about social

107
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,125
media and standup comedy.

108
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,245
I love this question 'cause it's interesting to me.

109
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,085
'cause I used to not like it. I was like,

110
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,725
I'll just be really funny and then somebody else will figure

111
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:29,805
that part out for me.

112
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:32,725
But that's just not the way the industry is anymore.

113
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,845
Like basically nobody's coming for anybody.

114
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,445
And uh, it's not about how funny you are.

115
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,245
It's, it's, it's how well how many people.

116
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,045
You can show how funny you are too.

117
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:44,325
And it's, people could be like, oh, that's, that's weird.

118
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,485
But I mean there used to be a lot of kiss asses

119
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,485
that would work comedy clubs

120
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,325
and probably get spots they didn't deserve.

121
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,965
'cause it used to be the comedy clubs put you in front

122
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,805
of the people, but now it's more like the people put you in

123
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:56,565
front of the comedy clubs, you know?

124
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:59,165
And I try to just stay genuine. That's what it is, man.

125
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,965
Honestly, it's just like on stage.

126
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:02,765
It's like the minute you start doing an

127
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,085
impression of yourself, you're f****d.

128
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,445
I see comics do that all the time and I see it online.

129
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,725
I see it in person where they're like, this is

130
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,885
what it would be like if I did standup comedy as opposed

131
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,485
to just coming up on stage and being funny.

132
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,565
I didn't, this wasn't like a plan.

133
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,565
Other people told me I should try it.

134
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:22,605
And now like in a lot of ways, like I love my life.

135
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,685
I'm like 53% happy. I used to only be about 51.

136
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:29,805
Now I'm probably like 53% happy. That's great.

137
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,925
And that's pretty good for a guy like me know.

138
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,365
So do your friends that told you

139
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:35,525
to get into comedy ever ring you up

140
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,645
and go, I would like a piece of that

141
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:37,665
Now? No, they

142
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:38,485
can kick rocks.

143
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:41,605
Alright, So what's kick for Sam?

144
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,285
Uh, you mean big picture or a little picture? Both.

145
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,525
Surprise me, man. Alright. Little picture.

146
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,885
I'm going to Eau Claire tomorrow. Big

147
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:50,405
Picture. Then,

148
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:53,685
Uh, I'm going to Chicago in a couple weeks.

149
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:58,805
Getting ready to do record two. Uh, my kids are growing up.

150
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,485
I have a, my family is generally like happy and healthy.

151
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,685
Um, I'm in the unknown, unknown.

152
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:07,445
Um, I never knew that I could have a life like this.

153
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,725
And, uh, I get to live it.

154
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,045
And people, the fact that people like

155
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,725
what I'm doing on stage and off stage

156
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:14,765
and like you're talking about like, people

157
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,565
that like my writing, I'm working on a book right now

158
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:20,885
with Pat Moriarty, um, who did my album art.

159
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:22,605
He was in Mad Magazine, all that.

160
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,805
I get to f**k with some really talented people, including

161
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,485
s**t heads like you and.
