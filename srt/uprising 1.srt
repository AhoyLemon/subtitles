don't have

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,000
children yeah but the other 364 days

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,840
just aren't the same when you have

children the reason Christmas isn't that

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,599

179
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,319
truth which is that black strip clubs

180
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,879
are way better than white strip clubs

181
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,919
like a million times better I didn't

182
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,120
know this until I went well because like

183
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,240
first off right when I walked in the

184
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,879

seen in my

211
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,280
life right in the club there was like

212
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,639
three dancers doing it all at the same

213
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,919
time sounded like somebody just won a

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,919
golf

215
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,879
tournament well I was very excited you

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,080
know cuz if someone in the room did win

217
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:37,080
a golf tournament it's probably

218
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,080
me so you you during the day sometimes I

219
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,560
know you do movie uh reviews for your

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
movie reviews for the night life in

221
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,440
Carbondale Illinois where I've worked

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,640
for 17 years yeah also I know you're a

223
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,279
proof reader very exciting I'm a Comm

224
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,680
Baron as I what's the biggest word you

225
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,120
know what's the biggest word I know

226
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,519
anti-

227
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,040
antidisestablishmentarianism I think is

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,519
the longest word in the dictionary I

229
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,440
thought it was pona ultra microscopic

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,680
silico volcanic coniosis that would be a

231
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,560
medical term I'm talking the Webster's

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,279
Dictionary Miram Webster what's the

233
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,959
difference between count

234
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,800
Scrabble what why why isn't a medical

235
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,880
term a word it's not that it's not it's

236
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,399
just not necessarily a word it's more a

237
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,240
medical term this a subtle distinction

238
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,959
so I'm right I'm

239
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,600
right correct guys I'm going to level

240
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,959
with you I'm not actually [ __ ] Steve

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,079
I just made that up for the joke uh I

242
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,440
did actually go on a real date recently

243
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,240
though uh and by that I mean I met a

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,680
woman from Tinder at a sports bar in

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,959
Roseville and we made out in the parking

246
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,800
lot cuz we're both

247
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,200
14 I'm kidding only she was 14 that's

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,680
not

249
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,399
funny what's the deal with consent laws

250
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,600
am I right no uh no but she was like 23

251
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,959
or something it's not really important

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,200
to the story but the point is we made

253
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,160
out it was a good date by all accounts

254
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,519
we made plans to hang out a couple days

255
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
later a couple days later I text her hey

256
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,360
how's it going and she responded pretty

257
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,519
good funny story I got back together

258
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,800
with my ex

259
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,399
today and I was like well that wasn't

260
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,240
funny or a

261
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,560
story you set that up so

262
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,600
wrong I think she should have said uh

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,920
pretty good relevant

264
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,519
anecdote won't be making out of Buffalo

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,519
Wild Wings

266
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,600
anymore I've been married for 18 years

267
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,959
myself so um yeah I know amazing I was

268
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,160
married at 12

269
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,680
um yeah it's been it's not the most

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,760
passionate relationship anymore I'd have

271
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,639
to say um this year we bought each other

272
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,079
um a sectional couch for our anniversary

273
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,240
and it was like the biggest couch that

274
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:53,120
they had to offer and then the year

275
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,560
before that we bought a king-size bed so

276
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
basically what we're doing is we're just

277
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
buying furniture that's so big that we

278
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,480
don't have to physically be near each

279
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,200
other

280
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,000
when we use it so it's working out great

281
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah and I I'm sure it's my fault that

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,360
the passion is gone I think I have I

283
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,880

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,639
is really that is rare and hard to

369
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,560
identify so the lady that hired me she

370
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,920
said uh you're going to go up do a half

371
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,480
hour of comedy please keep it clean I

372
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,600

374
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360

376
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
presentation was a woman who had a rare

377
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,839
disease it was that caused macular

378
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
degeneration she went blind and she

379
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,320
became a

380
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,600
photographer over the course of her

381
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,240
illness to overcome it was beautiful

382
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
don't laugh at that it's genuine that's

383
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,160
not that's this is the setup part of the

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,600
joke where you're not supposed to

385
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,440
laugh but no it was beautiful all of her

386
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000

and then they had another presentation

389
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
and it was a girl with a bone disease

390
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,160
and she became a [ __ ]

391
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,079
ballerina that's not a joke she did she

392
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,680

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,880
beautiful they showed a video people are

394
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,920
all uplifted I couldn't wait to go out

and perform for everybody and then they

396
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,360

this voice for about a minute and a half

515
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,320
and uh I'm feeling real uncomfortable

516
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,480
about

517
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,120

518
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,559
white dude doing this awesome voice

519
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,039
could be construed as

520
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,600
racist and I I want to ask a black

521
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,360
person if it's okay and I'm worried that

522
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,279
asking a black person if this voice is

523
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
okay while doing this voice would

524
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,440
definitely be

525
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,679
racist and also because uh there's one

526
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,279
black lady in the

527
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,400
room is this that's a if I could get

528
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,440
